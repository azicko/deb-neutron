    Configures RADVD to send managed flag in RA
    for DHCP_STATEFUL
    
    RADVD process is configured so that it sends
    managed flag in RA for the subnets with
    ra_mode set to DHCP_STATEFUL. UT case is
    updated to check the presence of managed
    flag in config file of RADVD for
    DHCP_STATEFUL.

    Fixes blocking of VRF config in Arista L3 Plugin
    
    This fix removes the restriction that Arista HW,
    when configured in MLAG (redunancy) mode, is not
    allowed to configure in VRF mode.
    
    Additionally, a minor fix to log message is made
    as the correct message is logged when an
    exception is hit.

    Fix AttributeError during startup of ovs agent in DVR mode
    
    Make sure the agent starts processing incoming requests only after the entire
    initialization is complete. This is done by making explicit when the rpc loop
    is supposed to start, i.e. right at the end of the init process.
    
    This fix was necessary because the agent starts processing rpc messages even
    though it has not completed the entire initialization of bridges and data
    structures; this is usually okay, but in case of DVR, this leads to a
    situation where during the the first run, the agent asks the server to be
    assigned a MAC address; this in turn leads the server to fanout the generated
    MAC to the running agents, the requesting one included; because of the
    incomplete setup, the above mentioned error occurs. During subsequent
    restarts, the problem no longer appears.

    Fix IPv6 Subnet Slaac Check
    
    Currently, "is_slaac_subnet" method only checks "ipv6_address_mode".
    This will let neutron allocate a stateful IPv6 address for instance
    when ipv6_ra_mode set to "stateless" or "slaac", and "ipv6_address_mode"
    unset. But actually, instance get IPv6 address prefix from radvd, and
    auto configure IPv6 address by itself. This change will let "is_slaac_
    subnet" also check ipv6_ra_mode attribute, which will no longer allow
    fixed IPs on auto-address subnets and delete subnet will correctly delete
    auto-address ports.

    Speed up initial L3 full sync time
    
    When a L3 agent starts up the initial full sync occurs
    on the first periodic task interval.
    This means that from the point the agent is ready to
    process updates it can take ~1 minute until traffic
    can start flowing through the L3 agent's routers.
    
    When using a highly available solution (not VRRP)
    the startup delay adds around a full minute to
    the minimum downtime.
    
    This patch simply does a manual (i.e. not periodic) full
    sync once the L3 agent is ready (in 'after_start' method).
    
    The change results in a much faster sync on a new agent.
    With the patch it takes several seconds until routers are
    created on the new/restarted L3 agent.

    Make L3 HA VIPs ordering consistent in keepalived.conf
    
    Currently the order of VIPs in keepalived.conf is determined
    by sorting the VIPs whenever one is added or removed. As it
    turns out, keepalived doesn't like it when the primary VIP
    changes. One side effect is that virtual routes, in our case
    the router's default route, may be removed.
    
    This patch fabricates an IP address on the router's HA interface
    and uses it as the primary VIP.

    Specify prefix length for IPv6 subnets
    
    If Network contains dhcpv6-stateful Subnet with prefix other than /64,
    dnsmasq refuses to start if prefix-len is not specified in dhcp-range
    option.  From dnsmasq(8) manpage:
    
        For IPv6, the parameters are slightly different: instead of netmask
        and broadcast address, there is an optional prefix length which must
        be equal to or larger then the prefix length on the local interface.
        If not given, this defaults to 64. Unlike the IPv4 case, the prefix
        length is not automatically derived from the interface
        configuration. The mimimum size of the prefix length is 64.
    
    It is safe to always specify prefix length, so dnsmasq will use correct
    configuration.

    Fix for KeyError: 'gw_port_host' on l3_agent
    
    The dictionary field 'gw_port_host' was added for
    DVR routers and is used by the scheduler and l3_agent
    to schedule where the SNAT port for a DVR router
    will be hosted.  In some code flows on the l3_agent,
    this field is checked to determine what the agent
    should do if the host matches its own or not.
    
    Recently it has been seen that the router data sent
    from the scheduler is missing this field in some cases.
    This causes the agent to throw a KeyError and not function
    properly.  This patch will make the l3_agent more robust
    and less fragile by calling 'get' instead of assuming the
    field will be there.
    
    More work may be needed on the scheduler side to see why
    this field is missing. That is why I am marking this as a
    partial-fix for now. But this patch will make the l3_agent
    less prone to errors and therefore an improvement.

    NSX: Remove logic for creating chained logical switches
    
    This patch removes the logic for creating chained local switches in
    the NSX backend for Neutron networks with flat or vlan bindings.
    Switch chaining as a feature is no more useful since the underlying
    backend limitation has been long removed.
    
    The logic for reading chained logical switches is however
    preserved by this patch, since some older neutron networks could
    still be mapped to chained logical switches.

    Reset policies after RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP is populated
    
    The REST API relies on neutron-specific policy checking logic that is
    only available after the extensions are loaded and the
    RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP is populated. This patch resets the policies
    immediately after these steps are done. This ensures that in the event
    the policies are prematurely loaded for any reason, the on-demand
    loading of the policies will reload the policies and properly configure
    the neutron specific checks on the next policy check.

    Issue warning when running DHCP agent with dnsmasq < 2.67
    
    dnsmasq < 2.67 does not support hwaddr matching for IPv6 clients, meaning IPv6
    stateful subnets fail to provide IP addresses to instances.
    
    Quoting dnsmasq CHANGELOG:
    
    "
    version 2.67
    [...]
        Support identification of clients by MAC address in
        DHCPv6. When using a relay, the relay must support RFC
        6939 for this to work. It always works for directly
        connected clients. Thanks to Vladislav Grishenko
        for prompting this feature.
    "
    
    We cannot just exit as we do for dnsmasq < 2.63 since that would potentially
    break DHCP agent startup for users that fetch the fix from git without bumping
    dnsmasq version.
    
    Appropriate release note will be added to notify operators about
    incompatibility issue.

    Fix neutron hang for IPv6 allocation pool update
    
    While rebuilding IPAllocationPools, Neutron is using netaddr.iter_iprange
    (a generator that produces IPAddress objects). For an IPv6 subnet, this is
    a costly operation and is causing Neutron Server to hang. This patch
    addresses the issue by replacing netaddr.iter_iprange with netaddr.IPRange
    which provides the same functionality while calculating the IPSets.

    Fix for FIPs duplicated across hosts for DVR
    
    For DVR, FIPs should be hosted on the single node
    which hosts the VM assigned with the fixed_ip of the FIP.
    The l3_agent should only take action on the correct FIP per
    host by filtering the FIPs based on the 'host' value
    of the FIP.
    
    A recent refactor on the l3_agent moved the host filtering logic
    from process_router_floating_ip_addresses() to
    _get_external_device_interface_name(). The local floating_ips var
    was not altered as it was before the refactor.
    
    This resulted in network disruption across multiple hosts
    since more than one namespace contained the FIP.  This problem
    would only be seen in a mutli-host environment where the same
    router hosting FIPs was present on more than one node.
    
    The fix is to return the host filtering logic by adding a
    call to get_floating_ips().  In addition, the unit test
    test_process_router_dist_floating_ip_add() was modified to
    pass two FIPs instead of one.  One FIP matches the host
    of the agent, one does not.  Only one should be processed,
    not two.

    ipv6: set OtherConfig flag for DHCPv6 stateless subnets
    
    In case of DHCPv6 stateless subnets, we should inform DHCP clients about
    other configuration values available from DHCP server. This is done by
    setting O (other) flag in RAs, which is controlled by AdvOtherConfigFlag
    setting in radvd case.
    
    Since radvd configuration file becomes quite complex, migrated its
    generation to Jinja2.
    
    Added a basic unit test that checks that flag is set for stateless mode
    and not SLAAC. For stateful, it doesn't really matter whether other flag
    is set, so no need to expect any value of it.
    
    No more unit tests seem to be needed: conditional prefix generation is
    already covered in test_l3_agent, and other statements are common for
    all ipv6_ra_modes.

    radvd: pass -m syslog to avoid thread lock for radvd 2.0+
    
    Since radvd 2.0, the daemon does not use daemon_fork() function from
    libdaemon, but instead calls Linux daemon() function directly. It also
    passes (1, 1) arguments when logging method (-m) is either stderr (the
    default) or stderr_syslog. The second argument's value = 1 means that
    stderr is not closed and left there for (some) log messages.
    
    For neutron, it means that corresponding execute() call that spawns
    radvd and expects the invoked process to close stderr does not ever get
    completed. The current thread that spawned radvd is locked waiting for
    radvd to exit, which does not ever occur unless the process crashes or
    receives a signal.
    
    Since L3 agent gives exclusive access to updates queue for each router
    to one of processing threads only, it means that the thread that got to
    serve a radvd-powered subnet will not proceed and not update any new
    ports or other changes to the router anymore.
    
    Passing -m syslog makes radvd 2.0+ close stderr and return to execute()
    caller, proceeding with router update processing. The same arguments
    should work for old (pre 2.0) versions of radvd too, so passing them
    unconditionally.
    
    We could instead use -m logfile and pass appropriate -l <logfile>
    argument to radvd to make it log to a log file located in router's
    namespace storage path. Though that would be not in line with what
    dnsmasq processes currently do for dhcp agent, where we log all messages
    to syslog, so sticking to syslog for radvd for consistency.
    
    Juno changes:
    - tests: we need to construct RouterInfo to get router namespace name.

    Eventlet green threads not released back to pool
    
    Presently, the wsgi server allows persist connections. Hence even after
    the response is sent to the client, it doesn't close the client socket
    connection. Because of this problem, the green thread is not released
    back to the pool.
    
    In order to close the client socket connection explicitly after the
    response is sent and read successfully by the client, you simply have to
    set keepalive to False when you create a wsgi server.
    
    Added a parameter to take advantage of the new(ish) eventlet socket timeout
    behaviour. Allows closing idle client connections after a period of time, eg:
    
    $ time nc localhost 8776
    real    1m0.063s
    
    Setting 'client_socket_timeout = 0' means do not timeout.
    
    DocImpact:
    Added wsgi_keep_alive option (default=True).
    Added client_socket_timeout option (default=900).

    return the dict of port when no sec-group involved
    
    Commit abc16ebf made the get_sg_ids_grouped_by_port function not return
    entries for ports without security groups. This causes the agent to not remove
    previously created security groups for that port since the port is not
    returned in the security_group_info_for_devices data.
    
    This change fixes that by always including a list of security groups for each
    port, even if that list is empty.

    Moves the HA resource creations outside of transaction
    
    Currently the HA resources are created in the
    _create_router_db which includes calls to
    the plugin and generates RPC calls. Even if the
    resource creations are outside of any transaction
    from the _create_router_db point of view, this
    method is  called in a transaction from the
    create_router method.
    This patch moves the resource creations to the
    create_router method outside the transaction.
    The failures are handled as previously with
    a try/expect.

    Delete FIP namespace when last VM is deleted
    
    On a compute node when the last VM with a floating IP association
    is deleted, the L3 agent did not delete the fip namespace. However
    the api server has already deleted the fip agent external gateway
    port from the database.
    
    This problem is happening on DVRs because the deletion of a VM port,
    in addition to a floating IP disassociation, may also result in the
    removal of the external gateway port binding AND the removal of the
    fip agent external gateway port.
    
    When the L3 agent is handling a routers_updated notification, it is
    not processing floating ip address updates when the router has both
    a floating ip disassociated and a external gateway port deleted.
    This patch corrects this problem.

    Fix race condition on processing DVR floating IPs
    
    Fip namespace and agent gateway port can be shared by multiple dvr routers.
    This change uses a set as the control variable for these shared resources
    and ensures that Test and Set operation on the control variable are
    performed atomically so that race conditions do not occur among
    multiple threads processing floating IPs.
    Limitation: The scope of this change is limited to addressing the race
    condition described in the bug report. It may not address other issues
    such as pre-existing issue with handling of DVR floatingips on agent
    restart.

    Fix enable_metadata_network flag
    
    The following patch: 9569b2fe broke the desired functionality of
    the enable_metadata_network flag, by not allowing the metadata
    proxy to be spawn for 'metadata networks', which are used for
    accessing the metadata service when the logical router is not
    implemented through the l3 agent.
    
    This patch enables spawning of the metadata proxy for metadata
    networks when the appropriate flag is set to True.
    
    The patch also adds rather pedant unit test coverage for the
    should_enable_metadata method which previously had no unit test.

    Teach DHCP Agent about DVR router interfaces
    
    When DVR is enabled and enable_isolated_metadata=True,
    the DHCP agent should only inject a metadata host route
    when there is no port with the gateway IP address configured

    when we look at each port's device_owner field, otherwise
    it will always add this route to the opts file when DVR
    is enabled.

    Fix hostname validation for nameservers
    
    Fixes the hostname validation to align with the RFC's demands[1].
    This was done by replacing the full regex with a function that
    broke the FQDN into individual components that were easier to
    reason about with regular expressions.
    
    Also added several test cases for domains so if someone wants
    to convert it back to pure regex there will be better test vectors.
    
    1. RFC 1123 says an all-digit hostname is allowed in section 2.1. It
       says that this more liberal syntax MUST be supported.

    Alter execute_alembic_command() to not assume all commands
    
    Alembic 0.7.1 is adding new diff directives add_fk and remove_fk.
    The logic in execute_alembic_command() appears to assume all potential
    commands are present in METHODS.   This patch adjusts it so that
    it checks METHODS first, allowing the tests in neutron.tests.unit.db.test_migration
    to pass.  However, if the design here requires that all potential
    Alembic commands are handled, then this would not be the fix,
    though I recommend that the potential list of Alembic directives
    not be hardcoded.

    Prevent an iteration through ports on IPv6 slaac
    
    A recent change[1] allowed subnets to be deleted even if they
    had active IPv6 SLAAC allocations on them. The updated check
    was inefficient because it would check every port in the subnet
    even if the subnet was a SLAAC subnet. This patch just shortcuts
    out that check.

    Fix metadata proxy start problem for v6-v4 network
    
    Commit 1b66e11b5d8c0b3de0610ca02c3e10b6f64ae375 introduces
    a new problem that metadata proxy will not be started when
    an isolated network contains ipv6 subnet with dhcp enabled
    and a ipv4 subnet.
    
    This fix separates the checks to enable dhcp and enable metadata
    so metadata proxy can be started if there is ipv4 subnet exists
    in the network with metadata enabled.

    Subnet delete for IPv6 SLAAC should not require prior port disassoc
    
    With the current Neutron implementation, a subnet cannot be deleted
    until all associated IP addresses have been remove from ports (via
    port update) or the associated ports/VMs have been deleted.
    
    In the case of SLAAC-enabled subnets, however, it's not feasible to
    require removal of SLAAC-generated addresses individually from each
    associated port before deleting a subnet because of the multicast
    nature of RA messages. For SLAAC-enabled subnets, the processing of
    subnet delete requests needs to be changed so that these subnets will
    be allowed to be deleted, and all ports get disassociated from their
    corresponding SLAAC IP address, when there are ports existing on
    the SLAAC subnet.

    BSN: Optimistic locking strategy for consistency
    
    Summary:
      Adds an optimistic locking strategy for the Big Switch
      server manager so multiple Neutron servers wanting to
      communicate with the backend do not receive the consistency
      hash for use simultaneously.
    
      The bsn-rest-call semaphore is removed because serialization
      is now provided by the new locking scheme.
    
      A new DB engine is added because the consistency hashes
      need a life-cycle with rollbacks and other DB operations
      than cannot impact or be impacted by database operations
      happening on the regular Neutron objects.
    
      Unit tests are included for each of the new branches
      introduced.
    
    Problem Statement:
      Requests to the Big Switch controllers must contain the
      consistency hash value received from the previous update.
      Otherwise, an inconsistency error will be triggered which
      will force a synchronization. Essentially, a new backend
      call must be prevented from reading from the consistency
      hash table in the DB until the previous call has updated
      the table with the hash from the server response.
    
      This can be addressed by a semaphore around the rest_call
      function for the single server use case and by a table lock
      on the consistency table for multiple Neutron servers.
      However, both solutions are inadequate because a single
      Neutron server does not scale and a table lock is not
      supported by common SQL HA deployments (e.g. Galera).
    
      This issue was previously addressed by deploying servers
      in an active-standby configuration. However, that only
      prevented the problem for HTTP API calls. All Neutron
      servers would respond to RPC messages, some of which would
      result in a port update and possible backend call which
      would trigger a conflict if it happened at the same time
      as a backend call from another server. These unnecessary
      syncs are unsustainable as the topology increases beyond
      ~3k VMs.
    
      Any solution needs to be back-portable to Icehouse so new
      database tables, new requirements, etc. are all out of the
      question.
    
    Solution:
      This patch stores the lock for the consistency hash as a part
      of the DB record. The guaruntees the database offers around
      atomic insertion and constrained atomic updates offer the
      primitives necessary to ensure that only one process/thread
      can lock the record at once.
    
      The read_for_update method is modified to not return the hash
      in the database until an identifier is inserted into the
      current record or added as a new record. By using an UPDATE
      query with a WHERE clause restricting to the current state,
      only one of many concurrent callers to the DB will successfully
      update the rows. If a caller sees that it didn't update any
      rows, it will start the process over of trying to get the
      lock.
    
      If a caller observes that the same ID has the lock for
      more than 60 seconds, it will assume the holder has
      died and will attempt to take the lock. This is also done
      in a concurrency-safe UPDATE call since there may be many
      other callers may attempt to do the same thing. If it
      fails and the lock was taken by someone else, the process
      will start over.
    
      Some pseudo-code resembling the logic:
        read_current_lock
        if no_record:
          insert_lock
          sleep_and_retry if constraint_violation else return
        if current_is_locked and not timer_exceeded:
          sleep_and_retry
        if update_record_with_lock:
          return
        else:
          sleep_and_retry

    fix event_send for re-assign floating ip
    
    Neutron can associate a floating ip to a new port
    without disassociate from original instance port.
    This situation will send network changed event only
    for new instance port, and that event object contains
    the new instance's id.
    
    In this case nova will update new instance's info
    but not original one's in nova's database table
    instance_info_caches. For nova can get new instance's
    id from the above event. So in table instance_info_caches,
    both original instance and new instance will have the
    same floating ip in their records. And this make it
    possible that, in most situation, after your re-assign
    floating ip, run "nova list" will return incorrect info,
    multiple instances have a same floating ip, and this may
    confuse users.
    
    Nova will sync data in table instance_info_caches, but it
    may take dozens of seconds.
    The new added code will send network changed event for the
    original instance, and this will make nova update instance_
    _info_caches table in a few seconds.

    Fix KeyError in dhcp_rpc when plugin.port_update raise exception
    
    KeyError exception is seen because of following reasons
    
    * DhcpRpcCallback._port_action() is called by two functions
       -  DhcpRpcCallback.create_dchp_port()
       -  DhcpRpcCallback.update_dhcp_port()
    
    * When create_dhcp_port() function calls _port_action(), the
      function argument 'port' will have the body as
      {'port': {'network_id': foo_network_id, 'fixed_ips': [..] ...}
    
    * When update_dhcp_port() function calls _port_action(), the
      function argument 'port' will have the body as
      {'id': port_id, 'port': {{'port': {'network_id': foo_network_id,
    			            'fixed_ips': [..] ...}}
    
    * If an exception occurs when _port_action() calls plugin.create_port(),
      network id is accessed as
      net_id = port['port']['network_id']
    
    * If an exception occurs when _port_action() calls plugin.update_port(),
      network id is accessed as
      net_id = port['port']['network_id']
      which is causing the KeyError. network_id should have been accessed as
      net_id = port['port']['port']['network_id']
    
    This patch fixes the issue by making the _port_action() take the
    same port body. update_dhcp_port() insteading of passing the port_id
    and port information in a single argument, it now adds port_id
    in the port body itself.

    Fix L3 HA network creation to allow user to create router
    
    Update HA Network creation to use an admin context to allow Neutron
    to create the tenant-less network required for the HA router when
    it does not yet exist and is being created by a non-admin user.
    
    Neutron creates these resources without a tenant so users cannot see
    or modify the HA network, ports, etc.  Port creation and association
    already use elivated admin contexts to allow their function when
    an user attempts to create a HA L3 router.

    Batch ports from security groups RPC handler
    
    The security groups RPC handler calls get_port_from_device
    individually for each device in a list it receives. Each
    one of these results in a separate SQL query for the security
    groups and port details. This becomes very inefficient as the
    number of devices on a single node increases.
    
    This patch adds logic to the RPC handler to see if the core
    plugin has a method to lookup all of the device IDs at once.
    If so, it uses that method, otherwise it continues as normal.
    
    The ML2 plugin is modified to include the batch function, which
    uses one SQL query regardless of the number of devices.

    _update_router_db: don't hold open transactions
    
    This patch prevents the L3 _update_router_db method from
    starting a transaction before calling the gateway interface
    removal functions. With these port changes now occuring
    outside of the L3 DB transaction, a failure to update the
    router DB information will not rollback the port deletion
    operation.
    
    The 'VPN in use' check had to be moved inside of the DB deletion
    transaction now that there isn't an enclosing transaction to undo
    the delete when an 'in use' error is raised.
    
    ===Details===
    
    The router update db method starts a transaction and calls
    the gateway update method with the transaction held open.
    This becomes a problem when the update results in an
    interface removal which uses a port table lock.
    
    Because the delete_port caller is still holding open a
    transaction, other sessions are blocked from getting an
    SQL lock on the same tables when delete_port starts
    performing RPC notifications, external controller calls,
    etc. During those external calls, eventlet will
    yield and another thread may try to get a lock on the
    port table, causing the infamous mysql/eventlet deadlock.
    
    This separation of L2/L3 transactions is similiar to change
    I3ae7bb269df9b9dcef94f48f13f1bde1e4106a80 in nature. Even
    though there is a loss in the atomic behavior of the interface
    removal operation, it was arguably incorrect to begin with.
    The restoration of port DB records during a rollback after some
    other failure doesn't undo the backend operations (e.g. REST calls)
    that happened during the original deletion. So, having a delete
    rollback without corresponding 'create_port' calls to the backend
    causes a loss in consistency.

    the port columns and using none of them. This resulted in a
    very expensive query with no benefit.
    
    This patch eliminates the unnecessary use of the port table by joining
    the IP allocation table directly to the security groups and allowed
    address pairs tables. In local testing of the method, this sped it up
    by an order of magnitude.

    Reduce security group db calls to neutron server
    
    Within ovs agent daemon loop, prepare_devices_filter will impose heavy workloads
    to neutron server in order to retrieve the security groups message to apply
    firewall rules. If agent is configured to use Noopfirewall driver or security
    groups are disabled, there is no need for loading the rules from server and
    refreshing the firewalls. This will reduce the number of db calls and improve
    performance for neutron server in this case.

    Big Switch: Don't clear hash before sync
    
    This patch removes the step of clearing the consistency
    hash from the DB before a topology sync. This will ensure
    that inconsistency will be detected if the topology sync
    fails.
    
    This logic was originally there to make sure the hash header
    was not present on the topology sync call to the backend.
    However, the hash header is ignored by the backend in a sync
    call so it wasn't necessary.

    Race for l2pop when ports go up/down on same host
    
    With l2pop enabled, race exists in delete_port_postcommit
    when both create/update_port and delete_port deal with
    different ports on the same host, where such ports are
    either the first (or) last on same network for that host.
    This race happens outside the DB locking zones in
    the respective methods of ML2 plugin.
    
    To fix this, we have moved determination of
    fdb_entries back to delete_port_postcommit and removed
    delete_port_precommit altogether from l2pop mechanism
    driver.  In order to accomodate dvr interfaces, we
    are storing and re-using the mechanism-driver context
    which hold dvr-port-binding information while
    invoking delete_port_postcommit.  We loop through
    dvr interface bindings invoking delete_port_postcommit
    similar to delete_port_precommit.

    Use EUI64 for IPv6 SLAAC when subnet is specified
    
    This commit uses EUI64 for SLAAC and stateless IPv6 address
    when subnet id in fixed_ip is specified.
    
    After this patch, all the ports created on a subnet which has
    ipv6_address_mod=slaac or ipv6_address_mod=dhcpv6-stateless
    will use EUI64 as the address.
    This patch also checks if fixed IP address is specified
    for a IPv6 subnet with address mode slaac or dhcpv6-stateless
    during creating or updating a port. If yes, raise InvalidInput
    error to stop the port creation or update.
    
    Remove unit test test_generated_duplicate_ip_ipv6 because
    fixed_ip should not be specified for a slaac subnet.

    Disable PUT for IPv6 subnet attributes
    
    In Juno we are not ready for allowing the IPv6 attributes on a subnet
    to be updated after the subnet is created, because:
    - The implementation for supporting updates is incomplete.
    - Perceived lack of usefulness, no good use cases known yet.
    - Allowing updates causes more complexity in the code.
    - Have not tested that radvd, dhcp, etc. behave OK after update.
    
    Therefore, for now, we set 'allow_put' to False for the two IPv6
    attributes, ipv6_ra_mode and ipv6_address_mode. This prevents the
    modes from being updated via the PUT:subnets API.

    On systems that start both neutron-server and neutron-l3-agent together,

    If a router is already unbound from an l3 agent, don't fail.  Log
    the condition and go on.  This is harmless since it can happen
    due to a delete race condition between multiple neutron-server
    processes.  One delete request can determine that it needs to
    unbind the router.  A second process may also determine that it
    needs to unbind the router.  The exception thrown will result
    in a port delete failure and cause nova to mark a deleted instance
    as ERROR.

    succeed, because the old one is holding the port already.

    remove linuxbridge plugin
    
    This changeset removes the linuxbridge plugin, but retains the agent for ML2.
    The database models were not removed since operators will need to migrate the
    data.
    
    Additionally, the ml2 migration script was altered to support Juno.  For
    testing, a user must either run the migration against the icehouse
    scheme or run the update, manually change alembic_version to juno and
    then run the migration script.  Once the juno migration is added, this
    manually step will not be required.

    ML2: move L3 cleanup out of network transaction
    
    Move _process_l3_delete out of the delete_network
    transaction to eliminate the semaphore deadlock that
    occurs when it tries to delete the ports associated
    with existing floating IPs.
    
    It makes more sense to live outside of the transaction
    anyway because the operations it performs cannot be
    rolled back only in the database if the L3 plugin makes
    external calls for floating IP creation/deletion.
    e.g. if delete_floatingip is successful, it may have
    deleted external resources and restoring the DB records
    would make things inconsistent.
    
    If a failure to delete the network does occur, any cleanup
    done by _process_l3_delete will not be reversed.

    Update migration scripts to support DB2
    
    Three of the migration scripts are causing failures with DB2.
    
    - DB2 doesn't support nullable column in primary key
    
    - Hard coded SQL statements which use False/True as Boolean arguments
      are not compatible with DB2. In DB2, Boolean columns are created as
      small integer with a constraint to allow only 0 & 1.
    
    - Hardcoded update rows from other table sql is not compatible with DB2
    
    - Foreign key constraints require additional handling

    Do not assume order of report list elements
    
    This fixes the test_report_multiple_services unit test that breaks with a
    randomized PYTHONHASHSEED (see the bug report).
    
    The test assumed that the report list from self.driver.report_status() had
    elements in a particular order. Found with PYTHONHASHSEED=2455351445.
    
    The fix refactors the test case to handle an unsorted report list by
    sorting it before checking equality.
    
    Partial-bug: #1348818
    
    Note: There are several other unrelated unit tests that also break with a
    randomized PYTHONHASHSEED, but they are not addressed here. They will be
    addressed in separate patches.

    The patch being reverted here addresses an issue that can no longer be
    reproduced, in that under no circumstances, I can make the FIP lie around
    before deleting a router (which can only be done after all FIP have been
    disassociated or released).
    
    Unless we have more clarity as to what the initial commit was really meant
    to fix, there is a strong case for reverting this patch at this point.

    fix dvr snat bindings for external-gw-clear
    
    When router_gateway_clear happens, the
    schedule_router calls the unbind_snat_servicenode
    in the plugin. This will clear the agent binding
    from the binding table. But the l3-agent was
    expecting the ex_gw_port binding to be present.
    The agent needs to check its cache of the
    router['gw_host_port'] value now.

    Forbid regular users to reset admin-only attrs to default values
    
    A regular user can reset an admin-only attribute to its default
    value due to the fact that a corresponding policy rule is
    enforced only in the case when an attribute is present in the
    target AND has a non-default value.
    
    Added a new attribute "attributes_to_update" which contains a list
    of all to-be updated attributes to the body of the target that is
    passed to policy.enforce.
    
    Changed a check for whether an attribute is explicitly set.
    Now, in the case of update, the function should not pay attention
    to a default value of an attribute, but check whether it was
    explicitly marked as being updated.
    
    Added unit-tests.

    Security groups: prevent race for default security group creation
    
    When a VM is booted via the Nova the client connection is created
    with an admin user. This causes problems when creating the neutron
    port. That is, there may be a race for the creation of the default
    security group for the tenant.
    The problem was introduced by commit acf44dba26ca8dca47bfb5fb2916807f9f4e2060

    Stop admin using other tenants unshared rules
    
    If the firewall rules are not shared and if they belong to different
    tenants, then admin should not be able to create a policy using
    these rules and he should not be able to insert such rules into
    policies. An exception should be raised in such case. Added new
    exception “FirewallRuleConflict” to handle such conditions.

    Eliminate OrderedDict from test_api_v2.py
    
    Neutron cannot possibly be passing tests under Python 2.6, as
    neutron/tests/unit/test_api_v2.py is referencing
    collections.OrderedDict, which does not exist in Python 2.6.
    Since there is no reason to use an OrderedDict in this case,
    this replaces it with a simple dict.

    Remove unnecessary _make_port function in BSN UTs
    
    The Big Switch unit tests had unnecessary copies of the
    _make_port function to allow the binding:host_id field to
    be set. This was already possible with the existing _make_port
    call through the use of kwargs so the extra function wasn't
    necessary.

    Do not assume order of device_ids set elements
    
    This fixes the test_ancillary_bridges_multiple unit test that breaks with a randomized
    PYTHONHASHSEED (see the bug report).
    The test assumed that the device_ids set had
    elements in a particular order. Found with PYTHONHASHSEED=2455351445.
    
    The fix refactors the pullup_side_effect function so that it checks if the
    device_id exists before returning the bridge.
    
    Partial-bug: #1348818
    
    Note: There are several other unrelated unit tests that also break with a

    Only setup dhcp interface if dhcp is not active on network
    
    When enabling (DhcpLocalProcess.enable()) dhcp for a network the agent
    first sets dhcp interface, then checks if dhcp is curently active and
    if it's true then the agent restarts dhcp.
    Restart (DhcpBase.restart()) first disables dhcp and then enables it again
    by calling DhcpLocalProcess.enable() recursively which in turn sets
    dhcp interface again (it doesn't see the port created earlier as network
    is not re-fetched from db). This leads to duplicate dhcp interface
    for the network.
    
    The fix is to only setup dhcp interface if dhcp is not active.

    HA routers master state now distributed amongst agents
    
    We're currently running with no pre-emption, meaning that
    the first router in a cluster to go up will be the master,
    regardless of priority. Since the order in which we sent

    master instances of all HA routers, defeating the idea

    Rework and enable VPNaaS UT for Cisco CSR REST
    
    The Cisco CSR REST client library unit tests were developed in
    Icehouse, using the httmock library. However, the community did
    not want to add this library to global requirements, as there was
    a similar httpretty library available (albeit with some short-
    comings). As a result, the test module was renamed with a "no"
    prefix, to prevent inclusion in automated tests.
    
    Since then, a new library, requests-mock, has been added to global
    requirements, to replace httpretty, and is being used on several
    other projects.
    
    This commit reworks the unit test to use requests-mock, instead of
    httmock. The functionality is the same, but the mechanism (a
    fixture with URI registration vs context manager) is different.
    
    This commit provides coverage for the REST client code, by using a
    mock for the Cisco CSR VM. The unit test module can be subclassed,
    and used with a real CSR VM, for 3rd party CI testing, in the
    future.

    Set dsvm-functional job to use system packages
    
    The functional job was breaking due to the interaction between
    devstack installing neutron system-wide in editable mode (pip install
    -e) and tox packaging in the same path.  Installing in editable
    mode meant that neutron.egg-info/PKG_INFO could be updated (in this
    case by tox) to change the installed version of the neutron package
    without updating scripts that depended on the installed version
    (e.g. rootwrap).  This fix is to set the dsvm-functional env to
    use system packages and avoid having tox update PKG_INFO.

    'test_port_prevents_subnet_deletion' method so this

    Delete DB records instead of tables to speedup UT
    
    Now that the schema is fixed for all of the plugins,
    there isn't a need to delete and recreate the entire
    schema for every unit test.
    
    This patch clears the tables at the end of each test
    instead of deleting them. This eliminated overhead seems
    to save 10%+ execution time of the entire set of unit
    tests.
    
    Example of performance gain from tox -epy27 tests.unit.ml2:
    Before: Ran 2495 tests in 284.186s
    After: Ran 2495 tests in 223.299s

    Separate Configuration from Freescale SDN ML2 mechanism Driver
    
    - In the current implementation, CRD configuration is existing
      within the code of ML2 mechanism driver.
    
    - When any other plugin/driver (like, Freescale FWaaS Plugin) need
      to use this configuration, it needs to duplicate the complete configuration.
    
    - So the CRD configuration is moved to a separate file for use
      in other plugin/drivers.
    
    - Unit testing of this MD is also updated.

    NSX plugin: set VNIC_TYPE port binding attribute
    
    A recent change has made this attribute required for nova
    integration.
    This patch adds this attribute to responses generated by the NSX
    plugin, and also ensures relevant unit tests are executed for the
    vmware NSX plugin.

    Access correct key for template name
    
    When an exception occurs while loading the config agent driver, the
    handler tries to log a message, but accesses the wrong key to get the
    template name. This causes another exception, which masks the original
    exception.
    
    This change accesses the correct key and performs logging inside a
    with block to (defensively) preserve the exception context.

    Fix DVR to service DHCP Ports
    
    This fix ensures that DHCP Ports that are
    available on DVR routed subnets, are serviced
    by DVR neutron infrastructure.
    
    Here servicing by DVR means, creation of
    DVR namespaces on such nodes holding DHCP
    Ports and also applying DVR specific OVS
    Rules to the br-int and br-tun bridges on
    such nodes, to enable traffic to be routed
    via DVR to such DHCP Ports.

    Add HA support to the l3 agent
    
    * Add HA mixins used by RouterInfo and LNAT3Agent
    * For HA routers: Internal, external and floating IP addresses are no
      longer configured by the agent. Instead the interfaces and addresses
      are passed to a keepalived configuration, which configures the
      addresses when the router transitions to the master state.
    * Only the master instance of the router opens the metadata proxy.
      This happens due to keepalived notification scripts that are
      called upon state transitions.
    * Extra routes are handled via keepalived virtual routes and are
      no longer configured by the agent.
    * HA routers create a 'HA device' on a VRRP-traffic only HA-network.
    * Functional testing: Add two new tests to the L3 agent:
        1) Translation of a router configuration to a keepalived
           configuration.
        2) HA specific events when creating a HA router - Assert that
           keepalived is up, etc.

    Fix KeyError on missing gw_port_host for L3 agent in DVR mode
    
    The order of Mixin imports broke the MRO, which caused some methods
    in the L3 hierarchy to be ignored. In particular, _build_routers_list
    for DVR was no longer called, which led to the stacktrace observed on
    the L3 agent side.

    Stop using intersphinx
    
    Remove intersphinx from the docs build as it triggers network calls that
    occasionally fail, and we don't really use intersphinx (links other
    sphinx documents out on the internet)
    
    This also removes the requirement for internet access during docs build.
    
    This can cause docs jobs to fail if the project errors out on
    warnings.

    Remove the Cisco Nexus monolithic plugin
    
    The Cisco Nexus monolithic plugin does not work without the Open
    vSwitch plugin. The Open vSwitch plugin is scheduled to be removed
    as per #1323729. This patch removes the Nexus Hardware switch
    related plugin code. The N1KV virtual switch related code will
    still remain in the tree as it doesn't depend on Open vSwitch
    plugin.

    This patch updates all schedulers in order to support the

    The schedulers aren't expected to work when creating a router
    that's both distributed and highly available. Specific issues
    will be reported as bugs and fixed in a future patch.

    Remove logic for conditional migrations

    Make Juno migrations config independent
    
    This patch amends migrations added after the icehouse release
    and before the healing migration.
    Migrations are changed in a way that they are not anymore
    dependent on configuration parameters but are anyway aware of
    the fact that the database has not yet been healed.
    
    To this aim, amended migrations now will need to inspect the
    current schema and cannot be anymore be used in offline mode;
    this is consistent with the behaviour of the healing migration.
    
    This patch does not remove the logic for generating and
    managing configuration-dependent migrations. For this reason
    upgrade and downgrade routines still accept the active_plugins
    parameter, which will not be used.

    This patch replaces folsom initial state and all migrations
    from folsom to havana, with a new, configuration independent

    In order to avoid large modules, "init ops" modules have been

    Cleanup floatingips also on router delete
    
    In router remove path process_router(), processing of floating ips
    is getting skipped. This change adds processing of floating ips
    if the external gateway for the router was previously set. Since
    DVR uses FIP namespaces and agent gateway ports, this change ensures

    Remove faulty .assert_has_calls([])
    
    Some UT use <mock>.assert_has_calls([]) as a way to check if mock

    In commit 5e4b0c6fc6670ea036d801ce53444272bc311929 NeutronDbPluginV2TestCase
    _do_side_effect() was renamed to _fail_second_call(), but the nexus test cases
    were not updated. The tests still worked because they check for
    HTTPInternalServerError which is the end result of the server encountering
    "AttributeError: object has no attribute '_do_side_effect'". So the fault
    injection still worked, but not in the way intended.

    Add L3 VRRP HA base classes
    
    Add L3 HA base classes on the plugin side. A new admin-only ha
    attribute is added to the API router resource. Conversion from
    or to HA router is possible. Each tenant gets a single network
    used for HA traffic. The tenant_id for that network is set to
    '' so that it isn't visible via the CLI or GUI. A new table
    is added to map a tenant to its HA network. Specific HA
    attributes are added to the extra router attributes table.
    Finally, each HA router gets a port on the HA network, per
    l3 agent it is scheduled on. A new table is added to track
    these bindings. A new table is added in order to track
    VRID allocations.
    
    DVR integration is not expected to work. Any issues will
    be reported as bugs and handled after the feature merges.
    Migrating a router to HA or from HA works server side
    but is not expected to work (Yet) agent side. This will be
    dealt with as a bug in the future.

    Don't allow user to set firewall rule with port and no protocol
    
    Creating firewall rules specifying a destination port and/or a source
    port without a protocol, generates rules without src or dest port
    restriction. This was a real security issue for cloud users.
    
    This patch generates a 400 Bad request "Source/destination port
    requires a protocol" in case of creation/update of firewall rules
    specifying a destination port and/or a source port and without protocol.

    UTs: Disable auto deletion of ports/subnets/nets
    
    Change the behavior of the unit test context managers
    for ports, networks, and subnets to skip the deletion
    of the objects they create.
    
    Adds explicit delete calls to the tests that require
    deletion of the objects.
    
    This is the first patch in a series to eliminate the
    automatic deletion of objects created during tests to
    improve test performance and make testing more explicit.

    Add unit-test assert to check dict is superset of dict
    
    Several VPN unit tests need the ability to check that an expected
    dict is found in the actual dict output (and that other elements are
    ignored - like auth tokens).
    
    Since this will be of use to other components, adding this to the
    base test case.
    
    Note: There is a similar assertDictContainsSubset(), however, it is
    not supported in 2.6 and has been deprecated in 3.2. A different, and
    hopefully clearer, name is used for this method.

    Fix AttributeError when setting external gateway on DVR router
    
    DVR routers will have this manager initialized only after one
    or more subnets have been attached to the router. To address
    the issue, make sure the manager is defined and handle the snat
    rules appropriately.
    
    This patch also makes _update_arp_entry more defensive; this is
    because the arp update process can be affected by the same issue:
    the router may not have internal ports at the time the request
    come in. This is likely when VM's port creation and router
    configuration overlap slightly.

    Stop tracking connections in DVR FIP Namespace
    
    For DVR, connections to external network using floating IPs do not
    need to be tracked in FIP namespace because they are being
    already tracked in router namespace.
    This fix adds iptable rules to not track connections.

    Fix leftover Timeout effecting most eventlet calls
    
    When registering a new eventlet.timeout.Timeout object, eventlet
    automatically starts a timer for most (if not all) future eventlet
    calls. Normally, eventlet codes do not hold a timeout unless such a
    timeout is used or a specific timeout length is specified through
    the API, but once a Timeout object is initialized, it is left there
    unless canceled.
    
    This change fixes an un-canceled Timeout which causes some
    functional tests to fail, reintroduces a fix for bug #1358206,
    which was written prior to discovering the uncanceled timeout, and
    increases the timeout of a test that depended on this timeout.

    Avoid auto-scheduling for distributed routers
    
    The reason for this is twofold:
    
    - It may relieve contention on DB access while
      both servers and l3 agents are busy setting up
      and syncing routers down respectively.
    
    - It prevents accidental placement of namespaces
      during the L3 sync_routers process, as auto
      scheduling without taking into account the state
      of the L3 agents, as well as the state of the
      routers being processed, may overrule the placement
      decision made during router operations.

    Don't spawn metadata-proxy for non-isolated nets
    
    If the configuation option "enable_isolated_metadata = True" for the
    DHCP agent is set, the neutron-ns-metadata-proxy process is spawned
    for all networks, regardless if they are isolated or not. In case
    the network is not isolated (ie. connected to a neutron router), the
    L3 agent also spawns a proxy process, and the DHCP's proxy is left
    unused. This patch adds a check prior to the spawning of new proxies:
    if a network is not isolated, no proxy is spawned.

    ofagent: Enable local arp responder for local VMs
    
    Because ofagent makes every arp requests packet-in and
    perform packet-out anyway, just make it respond arp requests
    for local VMs.  It would be simpler and more effective than
    forwarding requests to the network as it did before this change.
    
    Before this change:
        request: src VM -> switch -> controller -> switch -> target VM
        reply: target VM -> switch -> src VM
    
    After this change:
        request: src VM -> switch -> controller
        reply: controller -> switch -> src VM
    
    As a bonus, now we can test l2pop and local arp responder with
    a single node setup, at least for some extents.

    - Reduce the use of OFPP_NORMAL action.  Use mac address info

    - Use OpenFlow metadata instead of "internal" VLANs.

    Make SecurityGroupsRpcCallback a separate callback class
    
    RPC has a version of itself. In Neutron a plugin implements
    several RPC interface, so a single RPC version doesn't work.
    In Mixin callback class approach, RPC versioning depends on
    each plugin implementation and it makes harder to maintain
    RPC version appropriately. This patch series replaces mixin
    RPC callback of server side with a separate class.
    
    This commit handles server-side callback of security group
    RPC interface.
    * The server-side callback of Security group RPC is moved to
      api/rpc/handler and db/securitygroups_rpc_base now only
      contains a mixin class to add agent-based security group
      implementation with db operations.
    * get_port_from_device method in server-side callback class
      is moved to a mixin class of plugin implementation
      (SecurityGroupServerRpcMixin) because it involves DB lookup
      and is tightly coupled with plugin implementation rather
      than RPC interface definition.
    
    Most unit tests for SGServerRpcCallBackTestCase were skipped
    in the base class before, but now they are no longer skipped.
    
    The following items will be planned in later patches
    to avoid drastic changes in a single patch.
    * Merge security group RPC API and agent callback classes in
      agent/securitygroups_rpc into api/rpc/handlers/securitygroup_rpc
    * Remove completely duplicated db access code in get_port_from_device
      and get_port_and_sgs

    This kind of subnet hardly make any sense, and also cannot

    Fix state_path in tests
    
    cfg.CONF.state_path is set to a random temporary directory
    in neutron.tests.base:BaseTestCase.setUp. This value was then
    over written in neutron.tests.unit.__init__. Tests that need
    to read or pass cfg.CONF.state_path were getting the directory
    from which the tests were running and not the temporary directory
    specially created for the current test run. Note that the usage
    of state_path to set lock_path, dhcp state path and the likes
    was working as expected, and was not affected by this bug.

    On installing only neutron-linuxbridge-agent package, the
    dhcp cannot start successfully because of the imports from

    ovs plugin from ovs_lib.py. INVALID_OFPORT has been moved to
    ovs_lib.py while VXLAN_UDP_PORT has moved to
    plugins/common/constants.py. The imports for these 2 constants
    in files which uses it has been corrected to new location.

    Cisco VPN with in-band CSR (interim solution)
    
    Currently, the Cisco VPN drivers use two routers for the proof of concept
    solution. A Neutron router provides access to the public and private
    subnets, and a Cisco CSR (out-of-band) provides the VPN tunneling.
    
    The end goal is to integrate the Cisco VPN drivers with the Cisco L3
    routing plugin being developed (as a separate blueprint), allowing an
    in-band CSR to be used as a Neutron router for VPN functionality.
    
    This commit provides an incremental approach to that goal, by modifying
    the Cisco VPN drivers to be able to dynamically obtain CSR info from
    an INI file, instead of statically reading the INI file at start-up.
    
    A CSR VM can be created out-of-band (or in-band using Nova) and the INI
    file can be updated with the router info. Then, the Cisco VPN driver
    can use that information (dynamically) to create IPSec connections.
    
    Once the Cisco L3 router plugin is available, the INI file will be
    removed, and two calls to the plugin will be used to obtain the needed
    router information, for an integrated solution.
    
    The main advantages are:
        - Dynamically use the CSR for VPN.
        - Less manual intervention and setup.
        - Easy migration to final solution.
        - No dependency on the Cisco L3 router plugin implementation.
    
    Note 1: The INI unit tests are moved from device driver to service
            driver and modified.
    
    Note 2: I added a unit test for deleting IPSec site-to-site connection,
            which was missing (pass).
    
    Note 3: For more details on the change, you can view this Google Doc:

    Minor refactoring for add_router_to_l3_agent
    
    This method is more complicated than it needs
    to be, and it makes it difficult to target
    fixes for it.
    
    Furthermore, this method calls into
    auto_schedule_routers, which duplicates some
    of the DB calls already made in the above
    mentioned method. This refactoring
    is done in preparation of the performance
    improvement.

    Predictable iptables chains output order
    
    This fixes the iptables unit tests that break with a randomized PYTHONHASHSEED
    (see the bug report).
    
    The chains for iptables are stored as sets to avoid duplicates. When they are
    output by iptables_manager their order can therefore be unpredictable. This was
    found hash seed 1016732220.
    
    To fix this we:
     - Sort the chains output by iptables_manager
     - Update the unit tests to check for sorted chains
    
    When multiple tables are processed, they can be processed in any order or
    dumped in any order. Found with hash seed 3728666619.
    
    To fix this we:
     - Traverse the tables in sorted order for dumping
     - Fix tests to allow for tables to be processed in any order
    
    Note: There are several other unrelated unit tests that also break with a
    randomized PYTHONHASHSEED, but they are not addressed here. They will be
    addressed in separate patches.

    Heal script: Drop fks before operating on columns
    
    This patch fixes a small glitch in the healing script.
    If the script detects that a foreign key must be removed,
    and the columns that it references must be removed as well,
    then the foreign key removal would fail as the column would
    not exist anymore.
    
    This patch simply ensures foreign key are dropped before all
    the remaining table/column operations. New foreign keys are
    instead added after all table/column operations are completed.

    Fix DVR to service LBaaS VIP Ports
    
    Currently, DVR router namespaces are created only
    when there is a valid VM port on the compute
    node, or for the gateway-port on the service node.
    But when an LBaaS VIP port is created the l3 agent
    does not create a DVR namespace to service the VIP port.
    This fix enables DVR namespaces to be created to
    service the LBaaS VIP port.
    
    Also, this fix enables L2 Agent running in DVR
    mode, to add-in OVS rules to enable packets to
    be routed to such LBaaS VIP Ports which are
    resident on DVR routed interfaces.
    
    Therefore, with this fix both East-West and
    North-South traffic will be serviced by DVR
    for LBaas VIP Ports.

    Refactor plugin setup helpers out of test.base
    
    Helper methods for plugin and notification setup were previously
    defined on neutron.tests.base.BaseTestCase.  The imports required to
    support these helpers were preventing the api tests from consuming
    tempest due to configuration conflicts that resulted between neutron
    and tempest.  This change moves the helpers to a new module in
    tests/unit so that BaseTestCase can be safely used across all types of
    tests.

    Raise proper exception in case duplicate ipv6 address is allocated
    
    In case neutron tries to generate ipv6 address for slaac subnet,
    it doesn't check that generated ip is unique and throws DB exception
    that results in 500 HTTP error.
    
    The fix throws proper IpAddressInUse exception.

    Removing sorted() function from assertEqual()
    
    Removing unnecessary sorted() function from assertEqual() function
    calls in functions used for sorting and pagination testing
    
    Using sorted() breaks sorting tests objective which is to test sorting.
    This is causing every unit test using this functions
    (_test_list_with_sort, _test_list_with_pagination, _test_list_with_pagination_reverse)
    for sorting tests to always succeed
    
    Switched the parameters for assertEqual() function within the fixed code to meet
    its signature - assertEqual(self, expected, observed, message='')
    
    Test neutron.tests.unit.vmware.vshield.test_lbaas_plugin.TestLoadbalancerPlugin.test_list_vips
    was succeeding because of this bug, although it should fail. It failed after the bug was fix.
    Test was fixed.

    Add hook scripts for the functional infra job
    
    Infra jobs support hooks to customize behavior.  This change adds
    scripts that are intended to be called by the neutron-dsvm-functional
    jobs as hooks.   Defining hook behavior in-tree instead of directly in
    the job definition has the advantage of allowing changes in hook
    behavior to be tested before merge.
    
    The gate_hook.sh script added by this change installs a rootwrap
    filter to allow functional tests to destroy python processes that
    they have spawned.  The tests use the python executable provided by
    their tox env, and the default rootwrap configuration does not
    support killing processes launched by non-system python executables.
    
    This change will have to merge to master and stable/icehouse before
    the supporting infra config change can be merged:

    better to remove the parameter as a separate refactor so that it can
    be carefully reviewed.  The other patch [1] should be rebased to this
    one.

    Support Stateful and Stateless DHCPv6 by dnsmasq
    
    * This patch adds support for subnets created with 'ipv6_address_mode'
      set to 'dhcpv6-stateful' or 'dhcpv6-stateless' by dnsmasq.
    * If no dnsmasq process for subnet's network is launched, Neutron
      will launch new dnsmasq process on subnet's dhcp port in 'qdhcp-'
      namespace. If previous dnsmasq process is already launched,
      restart dnsmasq with new configuration.
    * Neutron will update dnsmasq process and restart it when subnet
      gets updated.
    * This patch enforces the version check of dnsmasq. dhcp-agent will
      fail to start if version of dnsmasq<2.63.

    Implements securitygroup extension for nuage plugin
    
    In Nuage VSP, the scope of vport-tag(Neutron securitygroup equivalent) is either
    per router or per subnet whereas securitygroup scope in Neutron is per tenant.
    Because of this, the mapping between neutron and VSP resource always happens at
    the port create or update time, such that port's router/subnet is known and
    thus sg attachment point in VSP is known.
    On port-update --security-group sg1, if this is the first port getting attached
    to that security-group, corresponding vport-tag(for sg) and rules( for sg rules)
    are created on VSP. Subsequent port-update for the same sg1 will just update the
    port to vport-tag binding. When security-group and security-group-rules are
    deleted on neutron, corresponding vport-tag and rules are deleted on the VSP.

    Add config for visibility of cisco-policy-profile
    
    This change adds a configuration option to cisco_plugin.ini to control the
    visibility of cisco-policy-profile among tenants. The default is false or
    unrestricted, so all tenants can view all policy profiles. If the option
    is set to true, tenants can only view policy profiles that are assigned
    to that tenant. The admin user can always view all policy profiles. This
    was implemented by adding a check of the configuration option in
    get_policy_profiles().

    Reorder operations in create_vip
    
    Previously VIP's port creation was moved outside the transaction
    to avoid deadlocks related to rpc calls.
    It led to small chance of VIP being fetched by rpc code with
    port being still None.
    
    This patch reorders VIP association with the pool so it's done
    only after port has been created.
    
    This patch also leaves small possibility of uncaught exception in
    case of pool being concurrently deleted in the process of VIP creation

    Change nexus_dict to accept port lists
    
    When users configured a server to have two logical connections to a
    single switch, the nexus driver would never know about the second
    connection because the nexus_dict stored the interface as a single
    value, which would just get overwritten.  This has been fixed by
    allowing the port value to be a comma seperated list.  All
    operations on ports have been update to loop over multiple ports
    per switch. New test added for host with dual connections to one
    switch.

    Update DVR Binding when router_id changes
    
    In this patch I modified update_dvr_port_binding to update the
    binding if router_id changes.
    When a new router namespace is created on a host, sync_router
    will call _ensure_host_set_on_port that will update the DVR binding.
    With the current code update_dvr_port_binding won't update the
    binding if there's an existing binding unless the binding
    vif_type is VIF_TYPE_BINDING_FAILED . There's a race when
    the router namespace is destroyed and then recreated on the same
    host.
    The DVR binding is deleted only when the message
    update_device_down is processed. If this message is processed
    after the update_dvr_port_binding triggered by the namespace creation,
    update_dvr_port_binding won't update the binding. When the router
    interface will be detected as UP, no DVR binding will be found.

    Skip FWaaS config mismatch check if RPC method is unsupported
    
    In this commit FWaaS config check skip is skipped
    if neutron server does not support this API.
    
    Commit d6f014d introduced FWaaS config mismatch check between
    server and agent. It added a new RPC method get_service_plugin_list
    and bumped l3-agent RPC version to 1.3, but this version RPC is
    only supported by L3 router service plugin and
    it breaks existing plugins using L3 router mixin.
    
    Bumping l3-agent RPC version requires detailed investigation on all
    affected plugins and it can be done by plugin maintainer later.

    NSX: lift restriction on DVR update
    
    The restriction in place in the code is not justified considered
    the capabilities of the DVR extension and the NSX backend.
    
    Transformations of centralized routers into distributed should be
    allowed.

    Use jsonutils instead of stdlib json
    
    jsonutils provides multiple benefits in comparison to pure stdlib json
    (like using simplejson on Python 2.6).
    
    Similar patch was already merged before [1], but since it lacked hacking
    rule to enforce jsonutils usage, new occurrences of stdlib json module
    usage were introduced.
    
    This patch switches all the code to using jsonutils and adds a hacking
    rule to enforce the rule.
    
    The hacking rule requires that jsonutils module does not mimic as 'json'
    thru using import renames, so the code was updated not to rename the
    module when doing import.
    
    The hacking rule was shamelessly copied from the corresponding nova
    review [2].

    Delete DVR namespaces on node after removing last VM
    
    After removing the last VM using a distributed router,
    the router's namespaces are still present on the VM host
    The problem is that the neutron API server sent the router
    remove notification to the L3 agent using the name of the
    host running the L3 agent instead of the agent's uuid. This
    caused an error when sending the notification. So the L3
    agent never had the chance to cleanup the namespace.
    This problem is fixed here.
    
    Afterwards, it was found that the notification was still not
    sent. The reason is that the router/L3-agent binding has
    already been deleted before the routine that sends the
    router removed notification was called. The notifier routine
    errored out when it tried to delete the same router/L3 agent
    binding. This problem is fixed in this patch by removing the
    binding removal step from the DVR scheduler.

    Fix PortNotFound error during update_device_up for DVR
    
    An agent's request to update the ARP entry for a VM port
    may come after a deletion request has been processed,
    resulting in a PortNotFound exception being raised.
    
    This patch takes care of this condition. A test has
    been added, which required a minor refactoring of the
    test case class, in order to accommodate the use of
    side effects for the objects being mocked.

    Option to remove routers from dead l3 agents
    
    Add a configuration-enabled periodic check to examine the
    status of all L3 agents with routers scheduled to them and
    admin_state_up set to True. If the agent is dead, the router
    will be rescheduled to an alive agent.
    
    Neutron considers and agent 'dead' when the server doesn't
    receive any heartbeat messages from the agent over the
    RPC channel within a given number of seconds (agent_down_time).
    There are various false positive scenarios where the agent may
    fail to report even though the node is still forwarding traffic.
    
    This is configuration driven because a dead L3 agent with active
    namespaces forwarding traffic and responding to ARP requests may
    cause issues. If the network backend does not block the dead
    agent's node from using the router's IP addresses, there will be
    a conflict between the old and new namespace.
    
    This conflict should not break east-west traffic because both
    namespaces will be attached to the appropriate networks and
    either can forward the traffic without state. However, traffic
    being overloaded onto the router's external network interface
    IP in north-south traffic will be impacted because the matching
    translation for port address translation will only be present
    on one router. Additionally, floating IPs associated to ports
    after the rescheduling will not work traversing the old
    namespace because the mapping will not be present.

    Remove SELECT FOR UPDATE use in ML2 tunnel driver add_endpoint
    
    SELECT FOR UPDATE expression, which is triggered with the use of the
    SQLAlchemy Query object's with_lockmode('update') method, is
    detrimental to performance and scalability of the database
    performance code in Neutron due to the lock contention it produces.
    
    SELECT FOR UPDATE can be entirely avoided in add_endpoint methods
    with the use of single-shot SELECT and INSERT expressions and the
    correction of VxlanEndpoint primary key: indeed previously it was not
    possible to create multiple endpoints with the same ip, now the model
    primary key constraint ensures it.

    Fix KeyError during sync_routers
    
    Method sync_routers is used by the L3 agent to query
    routers it knows about. Routers and GW ports lists
    are populated in two different times, which means that
    they can be interleaved by a delete request which
    results in gateway ports being missing in one of the
    two data structures.

    and then check the attributes for the router directly.

    Preserve link local IP allocations for DVR fip ns across restart
    
    The L3 agent allocates link local address pairs used in connecting the
    routers to the floating ip namespace.  When those allocations are
    forgetten by restarting the L3 agent they all get rewired on restart.
    This change preserves the allocations using a file in the local file
    system.  Storing them in the database would be overkill and would
    affect system performance.

    Fix 404 error fetching metadata when using DVR
    
    The metadata agent was unable to find networks
    attached to the DVR router because it was only
    filtering ports for 'centralized' routers.
    
    To fix the issue, this patch expands the search
    filters to include DVR router interfaces during
    the network lookup operation.
    
    The extra filter cause no evident performance
    loss while serving the request; a different
    approach would require to pass the router type
    around to narrow down the search filter, but it
    sounds like an overkill.

    Do not assume order of new_peers list elements
    
    This fixes the vpn unit test that breaks with a randomized PYTHONHASHSEED
    (see the bug report).
    
    The test assumed that the new_peers list from self.new_update_request had
    elements in a particular order. Found with PYTHONHASHSEED=2455351445.
    
    The fix refactors the test case to handle an unsorted new_peers list by

    Predictable field and filter ordering
    
    This fixes the fields and filters units tests that break with a
    randomized PYTHONHASHSEED (see the bug report).
    
    The RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP is stored as a dict leading to an
    unpredictable output order. Values in kvp strings are being stored as
    sets underpinned by dicts when converted, leading to unpredictable
    ordering of values when read.
    
    Discovered with PYTHONHASHSEED = 2455351445 on these tests:
    test_api_v2.APIv2TestCase.test_fields
    test_api_v2.APIv2TestCase.test_fields_multiple

    test_api_v2.APIv2TestCase.test_filters_with_fields
    test_api_v2.APIv2TestCase.test_fields_multiple_with_empty
    
    There are 3 parts to this fix:
    1. Update the APIv2TestCase _do_field_list function to construct
    field list in the same order as the controller constructs its list.
    2. Ensure the APIv2TestCase _get_collection_kwargs maintains order
    throughout.
    3. Use new assertOrderedEqual function to sort values before assertion
    in test_attr_info_with_convert_list_to

    MLNX Agent: Process port_update notifications in the main agent loop
    
    This patch changes the way mlnx agent process port_update notifications.
    It does the same for the mlnx agent as was done for the ovs-agent in
    I219c6bdf63b0b5e945b655677f9e28fa591f03cd.
    Processing a port_update notification directly in the RPC
    call may cause competition with the main RPC loop.
    To prevent this problem, the actual process of ports updates is done
    in the main RPC loop, whereas the RPC call merely adds the updated
    port MAC address to a set of updated ports.
    port_update notifications received within a single main loop iteration
    will be coalesced and processed only once.

    Fix session's InvalidRequestError because of nested rollback
    
    This patch addresses the issue by removing the extra nesting
    (which is effectively redundant).
    
    The longer story about this patch is the following:
    
    Race conditions may cause DBDuplicateEntry exceptions that
    require a transaction to be rollbacked back, and yet make
    the whole operation succeed. A classic example is what has
    been solved in commit fbc6b99. If the rollback is done in a
    nested transaction, the above mentioned exception is raised.
    
    To address the problem, we could use savepoints by means of
    sqlalchemy's begin_nested(); Even though this approach is
    preferable, it causes quite a bit of changes in the unit
    tests (because of sqlite); it may also require that certain
    DBMS, or certain DB backend configurations, support savepoints.
    
    In the end, the simpler approach was chosen.

    Remove unneeded device_owner field from l2pop tuple
    
    The DVR development added this device_owner to the middle of this
    tuple during early development because it was thought to be needed.
    Over the course of development, it was found to be unnecessary and
    much of the code that read it from this value was removed or
    obsoleted.  That job went unfinished and so this commit completes it.
    This essentially restores the code to what it was before and fixes the
    regression that was caused.

    Do not assume order of parameters in OVSBridge.add_flow call
    
    This fixes neutron.tests.unit.agent.linux.test_ovs_lib.OVS_Lib_Test.test_add_flow
    unit test that breaks with a randomized PYTHONHASHSEED.
    
    The test assumed that the parameters passed to add_flow had
    elements in a particular order. Found with PYTHONHASHSEED=2455351445.
    The fix refactors the test case to match parameters as set.
    
    Partial-bug: #1348818
    
    Note: There are several other unrelated unit tests that also break with a
    randomized PYTHONHASHSEED, but they are not addressed here. They will be

    Fix to throw correct error code for bad attribute
    
    Currently the neutron network API throws up error code 500 for
    the extended attribute for segmentation id. This can be reproduced
    if the user types in a random string in place of an integer value
    for the segmentation id. The proper behavior should throw an error
    code 400 with the appropriate failure message. This patch fixes the
    same issue and covers it with a test case.

    Improve external gateway update handling
    
    Once gateway is set, external_gateway_added() was getting called every time
     a router update was received. The check for change in external
    gateway compared previously cached copy of gateway port (ri.ex_gw_port) with
     the one passed in through update router (ri.router['gw_port']).
    The cached copy was already being modified by code so the two values would
    always appear to be different.
    Making the change to compare correctly and remove actions not required
    for gateway update.

    Simple refactor to stop passing around an unused parameter
    
    There is no functional change in this patch.  However, this refactor
    allows another patch [1] to make a simpler change to the code base.
    
    This patch includes localizing the initialization of "internal_cidrs"
    to a later spot in the "process_router" method.  This has the
    advantage that it will be initialized under the same condition that it
    will be used.

    l3_db: refactor L3_NAT_DB_mixin
    
    This patch refactors L3_NAT_DB_mixin to split out db operation and
    rpc notification.
    
    l3 plugin for routervm will implement the method for REST resource
    operation as something like
        def op_resource():
            additional operation
            with session
                additional db operation
                db operation of super class => super().db_op_resoruce
                additional db operation
            additional operation
            l3 rpc notification
    
    However, The current L3_NAT_DB_mixin intermixes db operations with l3 rpc.
    So it is difficult to reuse the db operation code without l3 rpc.
    This patch splits db operation from l3 rpc notification so that
    db operation logic can be reused easily. Thus the l3 plugin for routervm
    will be simplified with this patch.

    OVS flows apply concurrently using a deferred OVSBridge
    
    This change is an improvement of the commit
    501213686886baccd3280e10b8856a25d3517519 and provides a cleaner
    implementation. Previously flows were applied on
    OVSBridge.defer_apply_off which could be called by an other
    greenthread: it was impossible to ensure that all flows are applied
    in a unique OVSBridge.defer_apply_off call. This change ensures that
    all flows defined using a DeferredOVSBridge are applied on
    DeferredOVSBridge.apply_flows or DeferredOVSBridge.__exit__ if not
    exception is raised.

    Do not assume order of network_uuid's
    
    This fixes the neutron.tests.unit.test_linux_dhcp.TestDnsmasq
    .test_existing_dhcp_networks unit test that breaks with a
    randomized PYTHONHASHSEED (see the bug report).
    
    The test assumed that the network_uuid's list was sorted, so sort
    the result before comparing.
    
    Note: There are several other unrelated unit tests that also break with a
    randomized PYTHONHASHSEED, but they are not addressed here. They will be
    addressed in separate patches.

    Big Switch: Only update hash header on success
    
    This patch moves the hash update call into the success block
    of the server manager so the database isn't updated with
    a hash header from an error response. Additionally, it prevents
    the hash from being updated to an empty value if the hash header
    is not present in the response.

    Remove code to report port status for ancillary bridges because
    it relies on ovsdb.  While we could adapt the code to use OFP in
    a similar way we did for the integration bridge, it doesn't worth
    the effort because the almost same functionality can be achieved
    using provider network.  Update README to suggest the use of
    provider network.

    Add a tox test environment for random hashseed testing
    
    The newer versions of tox by default enable a random PYTHONHASHSEED. However,
    this breaks many Neutron unit tests, so PYTHONHASHSEED=0 is currently hard-
    coded for Neutron's unit test environments.
    
    We want to clean up the unit test cases that break with a random hashseed
    (there are many). To be able to find the broken tests and then verify them,
    we need to have an easy way of enabling random hashseed testing.

    Do not assume order of quotas dictionary elements
    
    This fixes the quotas db unit test that breaks with a randomized PYTHONHASHSEED
    (see the bug report).
    
    The test assumed that the quotas dictionary from plugin.get_all_quotas() had
    elements in a particular order. Found with PYTHONHASHSEED=1235130571.
    
    The fix refactors the test case to handle an unsorted quotas dictionary. Also
    choose some different quota limits to make it clearer what is being verified.

    NSX: Correct default timeout params
    
    Previously, req_timeout and http_timeout were set to the same value
    which is not correct. req_timeout is the total time limit for a cluster
    request and  http_timeout is the time allowed before aborting a request on
    an unresponsive controller. Since the default configuration allows 2
    retries req_timeout should be double that of http_timeout because of this
    this patch goes ahead and removes req_timeout as this should just be
    http_timeout * retries.
    
    Because prevouly req_timeout and http_timeout were the same this exposed
    a corner case that when the nsx controller returned a 307 we would issue
    the request against the redirected controller but in the case where the
    session cookie had expire when the request was issued we would get a 401
    response back and never retry the request. Now that the default values are
    corrected this issue should no longer occur as the next time time we issue
    the request we'll fetch a new auth cookie for the redirected controller.
    
    This patch also bumps the timeout values to be higher. We've seen
    more and more timeouts occur in our CI system largely because our
    cloud is overloaded so increasing the default timeouts will *hopefully*
    help reduce test failures.

    Fix-DVR Gateway clear doesn't delete csnat port
    
    When a gateway is set to a distributed router,
    the router checks for the interfaces associated
    with the router and based on the number of
    interfaces the router creates "csnat" interface
    ports that would be used by the SNAT service in
    the Service Node.
    
    When a gateway is cleared, the plugin should
    delete the "csnat" interface ports. In the
    current code, it is deleting the port and
    re-creating the port with a different id.
    
    A check need to be made before it creates a new
    port to make sure that the router has a valid
    gateway port.

    Use storage engine when creating tables in migrations
    
    Although __table_args__ is set correctly in the base model, existing
    migration scripts were not generated with the mysql_engine option in
    the alembic output, likely due to:
    
    https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic/issue/110/
    
    This adds the mysql_engine option to each table creation operation.

    Implement Midonet Juno Network Api calls
    
    This patch is the first in a series of converting the current midonet plugin
    code to the new model described in blueprint midonet-plugin-juno. This patch
    focuses specifically on the "network" handlers.
    
    This patch also updates the midonet UT to handle the new objects that need
    to be mocked with the new model.

    Replace nullable from primary keys in tz_network_bindings with default
    
    Columns vlan_id and phy_uuid were both nullable and primary keys.
    Primary keys cannot be nulls. This situation caused problems in
    autogenerating scripts creating always migration that set these columns
    to nullable.
    
    Instead of having primary keys nullable this patch creates a default
    values.

    Make sure that gateway is in CIDR range by default
    
    Git commit c3706fa2 introduced the force_gateway_on_subnet
    option that verified that the defined gateway is in the CIDR
    range of a newly created or updated subnet. However, the default
    value was False for backwards compatability reasons. The default
    will change to True and the option will be marked as deprecated.
    
    For IPv6, the gateway must be in the CIDR only if the gateway
    is not a link local address.

    Move ARP responder test to sanity command
    
    Additionally, the patch improves the check itself:
    To check if the currently installed OVS supports the ARP responder
    feature, we try to add a flow that references an OpenFlow ARP
    extension via ofctl. The test may fail due to an (expected)
    Runtime error, or due to some other unexpected error.
    In such a case the error was previously masked and tossed away.
    
    * Clean up ARP responder unit test
    * Extract ARP responder flow actions to be used by the unit
      tests, functional test as well as the ARP responder code itself
    
    After this patch, if the sanity check returned False but the
    user never ran it or ignored its results, the OVS agent will
    output errors to the log every time an ARP entry is (attempted)
    to be added or removed from the flow table.

    Race condition of L3-agent to add/remove routers
    
    This race condition happens when repeatedly calling
    l3-agent-router-add and l3-agent-router-remove
    by different neutron-servers at the same time.
    
    The primary key constraint is added for the pair of
    (router_id and l3_agent_id).
    
    During migration, verification is done if the current
    records violate the PK constraint defined in this bug
    fix, and sanitize the data before schema modification.
    
    Due to different dialects of database engines, different
    sql statements are executed correspondingly to do
    the verification.

    instead of deleting the secondary addresses, one of them will be
    promoted to primary ip.
    
    Without it, when init_l3 called on a port, it may unexpectedly delete
    some useful ips.

    Call config_parse in base test setup
    
    Some of the tests (e.g. NeutronDbPluginV2AsMixinTestCase) do not call
    config_parse so if the database engine is not already been setup by another
    test before the config object is reset on teardown, the database connection
    will fail since the database config is then empty.
    
    This patch adds a new setup_config method called during the base test case
    setUp method which calls config_parse by default to load the default config.
    Tests that couldn't use the default config were then modified to override the
    setup_config method.
    
    Some other unit tests were slightly adjusted to pass using the default config.

    Set python hash seed to 0 in tox.ini
    
    New tox (>=1.7.0) sets a random python hash seed by default. This is
    generally good for testing because it will help keep projects working
    regardless of the hash seed, but neutron unittests don't currently pass
    with a random hash seed so set it to the python default seed.
    
    This change will allow us to use new tox again and remove the
    restriction on tox<=1.6.1 to run unittests.
    
    Note this change will need to be backported to the stable branches to
    keep unittests there working with new tox as well.

    Nuage plugin maintains a mapping of Openstack and Nuage resources.
    With this change Nuage VSD can itself maintain this mapping, so the

    This eliminates potential out of sync and upgrade issues.

    This is the second part of a 2 part commit.
    
    The review is submitted in two parts:
    - Part 1
        The Mechanism Driver to support port binding for SR-IOV virtual
    	functions of SRIOV capable switching NICs.
    
    - Part2 (this part)
        The SRIOV NIC Based L2 Agent.
    	Use  configurable list of mappings physical_networks to PF
            interfaces and configurable list of mappings PF interfaces
            to list of excluded VFs to get list of Virtual Functions that agent should manage.
    	Current implementation supports admin state updates.

    Modify L3 Agent for Distributed Routers
    
    This patch is an enhancement to the existing L3 Agent.
    This allows the L3 Agent to support distributed routers
    by enhancing the router object to function across
    multiple nodes.
    
    Utilized two new types of namespaces:
    
    - FIP to handle multiple VM fips and routers per node
    - SNAT to handle centralized SNAT per router
    
    Rules and tables are enhanced and added to support routing
    across distributed routers without going to a centralized
    router.
    
    Finally, a new configuration param 'agent_mode' is introduced
    and it controls what the L3 agent can do: the available values
    are: 'legacy', 'dvr', 'dvr_snat' (more details inline).
    
    The l3-scheduler uses the newly introduced agent_mode to
    determine what L3 agent to select during the scheduling
    process.

    OFAgent: Share codes of l2-population in OVS agent
    
    This is step 1 implementation of OFAgent l2-population.
    OFAgent partially uses codes in OVS agent on implementation of l2-population.
    We share these codes adding mixin class for OVS to l2-population rpc.
    We use a ryu library instead of executing a ovs-vsctl command
    and on OFAgent l2-population is no longer optional.
    Also a function of local arp responder will be implemented on step 2.

    This patch changes the name of directory from mech_arista to arista
    
    This name change of directroy is needed so that additional drivers
    can be moved into this directory and share the code among drivers.
    
    In order to accomodate this name change, setup.cfg is modified to
    point to the Arista ML2 driver at the new location. Additionally,
    a similar new directroy is created for test files as well.

    ML2 mechanism driver for SR-IOV capable NIC based switching, Part 1
    
    This set of changes introduces the ML2 mechanism driver for SR-IOV capable NIC based switching.
    Please see the blueprint for more information.
    The review is submitted in two parts:
    - Part 1 (this part)
        The Mechanism Driver to support port binding for SR-IOV virtual functions of
        SRIOV capable switching NICs, such as Mellanox ConnectX Family.
    
        Use configurable list of supported NIC vendor and product PCI ids to filter
        devices to bind the SR-IOV port.
        Use configurable agent_required option to require SRIOV L2 Agent
        for bort binding.
    
    - Part2
        The SRIOV NIC Based L2 Agent.

    Add rule for updating network's router:external attribute
    
    Set admin_only rule for update_network:router:external in policy.json
    
    Also, change the default value of router:external from attr.ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED
    to False, because each time we try to get or update a network the dict with
    its attributes is extended by _extend_network_dict_l3 function which adds
    router:external=False to the dict if this attribute is not specified.
    Thus, if the default value is not specified, router:external is considered
    to be updated in any case and the policy rule is applied.

    L2 Agent-side additions to support DVR
    
    This patch introduces changes to the L2 agent, whereby the L2 agent
    relies on a DVR component that takes care of the port wiring and the
    management of tunnels in face of topology changes due to the life
    cycles or VM's as well as the life cycles of distributed virtual
    routers.
    
    Support for DVR needs to be explicitly enabled. Default behavior
    remains unchanged.

    NSX: fix router ports port_security_enabled=False
    
    Previously there was a bug that resulted in a security group being
    added to router ports which was not supported in NSX. Removing the
    security group didn't actually completely solve the problem as we
    never cleared the allowed_address_pairs on the router port. This
    patch fixes this issue by disabling port_security_enabled on the
    router port.

    call security_groups_member_updated in port_update
    
    When a running VM is added to a security group, all existing VMs (ports)
    in the security group should be notified/updated - otherwise they would
    have incorrect rules, not knowing the new VM/port added.
    
    The current behavior would only update the port of the added VM. This
    patch forces an security_groups_member_updated() call for all the
    security groups that have ports removed or added.

    NSX: fix validation logic on network gateway connect
    
    This patch adds validation for the segmentation ID when the
    network type for the gateway connection is vlan.
    This will avoid requests with invalid vlan IDs are sent to
    the backend resulting in 500 error responses being
    returned to API users.
    
    To this aim this patch slightly alters the current validation
    logic due to the fact that some checks are unnecessary since
    the same routine sets default values which avoid the
    conditions being checked.

    Fix DVR regression for ofagent
    
    Background:
        ML2 plugin sometimes uses truncated port uuids.
        For example, in the case of ofagent and linuxbridge,
        if port id is 804ceaa1-0e3e-11e4-b537-08606e7f74e7,
        an agent would send "tap804ceaa1-0e" to the plugin.
        ML2 plugin's _device_to_port_id() would restore it to
        "804ceaa1-0e".  While it's still truncated, ML2 plugin's
        get_port() handles that by using "startswith".
    
    The recently merged DVR change (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/102332/)
    assumes that port_id is always a complete uuid (it's the case
    for openvswitch) and fails to handle the above mentioned case.
    This commit fixes the regression.

    L2 Model additions to support DVR
    
    This patch introduces the models, the DB migrations
    and the config options required by the L2 layer to
    support DVR east/west traffic.
    
    These changes will be used by the control-plane made
    of ML2, L2pop and L2 agent.
    
    Two new configuration options have been introduced:
    'dvr_base_mac' is used to set DVR MAC addresses apart
    from tenant ones (every distributed router will have
    ports being created on compute hosts) and
    'enable_distributed_routing' is used to enable dvr
    support in the L2 agent. This gives the capability of
    rolling out the dvr functionality in stages.

    Fixed audit notifications for dhcp-agent-network
    
    dhcp-agent-network-add and dhcp-agent-network-remove do not
    generate audit notifications which are used for security
    compliance.
    CRUD operations of core network resources are handled by
    neutron/api/v2/base.py. In base.py, each of create(), update(),
    delete() methods makes calls to oslo.messaging.Notifier.info()
    to generate these notifications.
    In the proposed fix, it is fixed in a similar fashion in
    extensions/dhcpagentscheduler.py inside create() and delete()
    methods by introducing info() method calls inside them.

    For downgrade with postgres it is not enough to just drop_table if

    VPNaaS: Separate validation for Cisco impl
    
    Moving validation logic from Cisco service driver, into a
    validation subclass, so that it'll be applied during the
    persistence phase (so validation failures can block the
    persistence, instead of setting to error state).
    
    This is part of the effort to separate out L3 validation
    and builds upon the reference implementation changes being
    reviewed in 102351.
    
    Note: One unit test is commented out, due to a bug in
    oslo.messaging 1.3.0. It will be uncommented later, once
    1.4.0.0.a3 or newer is available for use.

    VPNaaS: separate out validation logic for ref impl
    
    Modify the persistence logic for VPNaaS to separate out the
    validation for the reference implmentation. This allows
    providers to override/extend the validation, as needed.
    Additional commits will address the separation for other
    providers and for other L3 services.
    
    In addition, the logic that sets default values for optional
    attributes is also moved into separate methods to allow
    providers to override the defaults used.
    
    Only attributes that have multiple validations are considered
    at this time, but this can be extended, as needed.
    
    Currently, one UT fails due to an oslo.messaging bug that
    has been fixed, but not yet released for Neutron use.
    As a workaround, the affected test case has been commented
    out. This test verifies that the right (only, in this case)
    device driver is used for validation. Once the issue with
    releasing oslo.messaging 1.4.0.0a2 or newer is resolved,
    this can be uncommented.
    
    In the future, TaskFlow may be used for the L3 services workflow,
    and these changes will provide validation modularization for that
    effort.

    Add L3 Extension for Distributed Routers
    
    This patch introduces the model and extension
    framework for implementing distributed virtual
    routing on top of Open vSwitch.
    
    A new admin-only 'distributed' (as opposed to a
    'centralized' or legacy-mode) attribute is added
    to the API router resource. It is possible to convert
    an existing (centralized) router to a distributed
    one; the opposite conversion, even though allowed by
    the API, may not be honored by the underlying
    plugin implementation and an appropriate error will
    be reported.
    
    When creating a router (regardless of the user role),
    Neutron will rely on a system wide configuration, whose
    default currently allows to create 'centralized' routers.
    
    Tests are added for basic unit coverage; when the first
    building blocks for neutron-testing-refactor
    are complete, functional testing will be added.
    This is because we should be moving away from how
    extension tests have been done up until now.

    was undeclared.This fix declares the variable with a default value
    at the beginning of the method.

    L3 agent prefers RPC messages over full sync
    
    When the L3 agent starts up and runs the sync task it doesn't process
    any incoming RPC events until the sync task is complete.
    
    This change combines the work from _rpc_loop and _sync_routers_task in
    to a single loop called _process_routers_loop.  This loop spawns
    threads that pull from a priority queue.  The queue ensures that RPC
    messages are handled before _process_routers_loop.  The latter is
    generally maintenance tasks triggered by the agent rather than user
    triggered tasks.
    
    Synchronization between RPC and sync routers loops is no longer
    necessary since they both feed in to a single queue.  There were
    places where it was necessary to reorder some things to allow for the
    lack of synchronization.  For example, it is necessary to list
    namespaces before fetching the full list of routers to ensure that it
    doesn't delete a new namespace that gets created after listing
    namespaces.  The lack of the need for synchronization between loops is
    probably the main strength of this patch.
    
    With multiple worker threads, need to handle the case where an RPC
    message came in while a thread was working on a router.  Another
    thread should not handle the same router that is already in progress.
    Adds a mechanism to signal to the working thread that an update came
    in for the router it is working on.  The original thread will repeat
    processing the router when it is finished to get the update.
    Multiple rapid updates to the same router will be consolidated.
    Essentially, there is still synchronization of work for a given router
    but not between routers.  Much better than before.

    Dnsmasq config files syntax issue when dhcp_domain is empty
    
    When using dhcp-agent with the following property dhcp_domain=""
    addn_hosts and host files genererated for Dnsmasq have wrong syntax
    concerning hostname parameter (dot char at the end).
    
    As described in RFC-952 the hostname grammar is as follows:
    <hname> ::= <name>*["."<name>]
    <name>  ::= <let>[*[<let-or-digit-or-hyphen>]<let-or-digit>]
    Hence it can't be conclude with a dot char.
    
    Dnsmasq process is waiting for a hostname (2nd parameter) in the
    following files:
    "addn_hosts" file contains:
       20.0.0.3 host-20-0-0-3. host-20-0-0-3
    "host" file contains:
       fa:16:3e:bf:e1:e4,host-20-0-0-3.,20.0.0.3
    
    With the patch you will get:
    "addn_hosts":
       20.0.0.3 host-20-0-0-3 host-20-0-0-3
    "host":
       fa:16:3e:bf:e1:e4,host-20-0-0-3,20.0.0.3

    Fixed audit notifications for l3-agent-router ops
    
    l3-agent-router-add and l3-agent-router-remove do not
    generate audit notifications which are used for security
    compliance.
    CRUD operations of core network resources are
    handled by neutron/api/v2/base.py. In base.py, each of
    create(), update(), delete() methods makes calls to
    oslo.messaging.Notifier.info() to generate these notifications.
    In the proposed fix, it is fixed in a similar fashion in
    extensions/l3agentscheduler.py inside create() and delete()
    methods by introducing info() method calls inside them.

    ML2: Bind ports outside transactions
    
    The ML2 plugin now calls the bind_port() operation on the registered
    mechanism drivers outside of any enclosing DB transaction. Ports are
    created or updated in one transaction, then a binding is established
    if possible, and finally a second transaction commits the binding
    result.
    
    With [re]binding moved outside the DB transaction that triggered it,
    it is now possible that multiple threads or processes will
    concurrently try to bind the same port, or that the port will be
    updated between transactions. Concurrent attempts to bind the same
    port are allowed to proceed, which results are used is resolved in the
    second transaction, and binding is retried if necessary.
    
    Improvements to the Cisco Nexus driver and unit tests from Rich Curran
    needed due to the binding changes are also included.

    NSX: Optionally not enforce nat rule match length check
    
    This patch adds the 'raise_on_len_mismatch' parameter to the
    'delete_nat_rules_by_match' function. The plugin then leverages
    this parameter for ensuring NAT rules deletion operations
    are completed successfully even when duplicate rules are found
    or no corresponding rules are found at all.
    
    With this change, the 'remove_router_interface' operation will
    correctly complete even in cases when NAT rules in Neutron and
    the NSX backend are out of sync.
    
    This patch also changes a check in delete_nat_rules_by_match in
    order to make it less expensive.

    Allow unsharing a network used as gateway/floatingip
    
    If network has ports that connect it as gateway to another network, such
    as an external network, or "floating ip" ports it should still be
    possible to "unshare" it since these ports represent usage of the
    network as an external network, not as a VM data network.

    Change all occurences of no_delete to do_delete
    
    Previously, ports, networks and subnets had a do_delete=True
    parameter. By default, these resources were deleted at the
    end of the context manager scope. All other resources used
    a different semantic: no_delete=False.
    
    This caused confusing situations such as:
    with self.subnet(network, do_delete=False) as subnet:
        with self.security_group(no_delete=True) as sg:
            pass
    
    Now all resources use the same do_delete semantic.

    Split up metering test case into plugin + test case
    
    Currently the metering test case includes setUp code as well
    as the tests themselves. Splitting up the test case class
    into two allows other test cases to inherit the metering
    plugin class without inherting (And implicitly re-running)
    the tests themselves.

    The add and remove router interface methods check that interface_info
    is not empty but don't check if it contains any of expected parameters:
    port_id and subnet_id
    This patch adds a helper method to validate that interface_info contains

    as well because this 'defaut' can be reached only via code. This
    change adds 'server_default' parameter to models and in database,
    so if someone will use SQL query it will also use default value.
    
    For model Router added parameter server_default. In migration it was
    added by this change https://review.openstack.org/105212.
    
    For model MeteringLabelRule added parameter server_default.
    In migration it will be added by heal script due to problems

    Add a gate-specific tox env for functional tests
    
    The functional gate jobs (*-neutron-dsvm-functional) need special
    configuration (e.g. OS_SUDO_TESTING, OS_ROOTWRAP_CMD) to run tests.
    This patch adds a new gate-specific tox env (tox -e dsvm-functional)
    that sets the appropriate values and allows easy duplication of the
    results of the upstream job on a host that has successfully run
    devstack with neutron enabled.
    
    A new configuration option, OS_FAIL_ON_MISSING_DEPS, is also set by
    the dsvm-functional tox env to ensure that dependency failures will
    result in failures rather than skips when run in the gate.

    NSX: remove unnecessary checks on network delete
    
    Since commit b50e66f router interfaces are not deleted
    automatically when the network hosting them is deleted.
    
    The NSX plugin still has additional logic to ensure all the
    corresponding backend resources have been deleted as well.
    Such logic is now obsolete and can be removed. Moreover it
    also wasteful as it perform queries for retrieving NSX
    resource identifiers.
    
    This patch also amends a few related log statement to make

    Do not mark device as processed if it wasn't
    
    Currently treat_devices_added_or_updated in the OVS agent skips
    processing devices which disappeared from the integration bridge
    during the agent loop.
    This is fine, however the agent should not mark these devices as
    processed. Otherwise they won't be processed, should they appear
    again on the bridge.
    
    This patch ensures these devices are not added to the current
    device set.
    
    The patch also changes treat_devices_added_or_updated. The
    function now will return the list of skipped devices and not
    anymore a flag signalling whether a resync is required.
    With the current logic a resync would be required if retrieval
    of device details fails. With this change, the function
    treat_devices_added_or_updated will raise in this case and the
    exception will be handled in process_network_ports.
    
    For the sake of consistency, this patch also updates the
    similar function treat_ancillary_devices_added in order to
    use the same logic.
    
    Finally, this patch amends an innaccurate related comment.

    VPNaaS REST Client UT Broken
    
    When the H302 work was done, it broke two modules used for UT of
    Cisco CSR VPNaaS REST client. Since the UT is currently disabled
    (because the httmock library was not approved for test-requirements),
    the error was not detected.
    
    This fixes the files, so that they can still be used manually (by
    locally importing httmock or its source file, and renaming the
    module to remove the "_" prefix).
    
    In the long term, the UT needs to be reworked to use httpretty,
    which uses a register based mechanism, instead of a context
    manager based mechanism, so this will take some effort. In addition.
    there is discussion of switching to a new mock-request package,
    instead of httpretty.

    Avoid notifying while inside transaction opened in delete_port()
    
    delete_port() calls to disassociate_floatingips() while in transaction.
    The latter method sends RPC notification which may result in eventlet
    yield. If yield switches a thread to another one that tries to access
    the same floating IP object in db as disassociate_floatingips() method
    does, we're locked and get db timeout.
    
    We should avoid calling to notifier while under transaction.
    
    To achieve this, I introduce a do_notify argument that controls whether
    notification is done by disassociate_floatingips() itself or delegated
    to caller. Callers that call to disassociate_floatingips() from under
    transactions should handle notifications on their own. For this,
    disassociate_floatingips() returns a set of routers that require
    notification.
    
    Updated drivers to reflect new behaviour. Added unit test.

    sync periodic_task fix from incubator
    
    Set the value of time the periodic task was last run to a multiple of the
    spacing value rather than the actual last time run. This ensures tasks runs
    regularly but avoids synchronizing that interval with other nodes.
    
    This patch also removes the coalescing of tasks which are _nearby_ (0.2

    Fix UnboundLocalError raised during L3 router sync task
    
    This can be fixed in a number of ways: a) consolidating the
    two except clauses into one; b) adding a 'return' after the
    last except clause c) by calling the cleanup method only on
    success; d) initializing 'routers' before usage.
    
    Approach c) has the benefit of stating the developer's intent
    more explicitly and minimize chances of regression.

    Allow setting a rootwrap cmd for functional tests
    
    Previously, sudo-requiring functional tests hardcoded the use of
    'sudo' as the root helper.  Devstack gate jobs do not allow
    password-less invocation of 'sudo', though, so such tests were unable
    to run in the gate.  This patch adds the ability to configure the
    rootwrap command installed by devstack by setting the OS_ROOTWRAP_CMD
    environment variable in the test execution environment, allowing
    sudo-requiring tests to run.

    BSN: Remove db lock and add missing contexts
    
    Adds context tracking decorators that were missing
    from router interface methods. Without them, new
    sessions were being created instead of using the
    existing context which was causing transaction
    issues.
    
    Modifies the servermanager to store context references
    as weakrefs so if multiple functions are called before
    the rest functions are called, the first one doesn't steal
    the only context reference with a pop() call.
    
    Removes a DB lock for update in the server manager that occured
    during rest calls that was triggering deadlocks due to the
    file lock synchronization for the rest calls.

    tenant_id will now be consistent among all resources created.
    This is important when getting or listing resources by tenant_id.

    lb-agent: ensure removed devices get treated on resyncs
    
    The previous exception handling in daemon_loop reprocessed all existing
    devices as if they were new devices. However, it did not ensure that
    any removed devices got cleaned up properly. This could result in
    leftover security group iptables rules from deleted instances.
    
    This patch refactors daemon_loop and scan_devices so devices that were
    flagged for cleaning will get retreated in the next iteration if there
    is an exception.

    OVS agent: Correct bridge setup ordering
    
    This patch fixes three issues that combined to break tunnel networks.
    
    The first issue was the the failure mode was being set on the
    integration bridge after the canary flow was installed. This
    immediately wiped out the canary flow.
    
    The second problem was that the main loop would sync tunnel networks
    right before resetting the tunnel bridge when the canary flow was
    missing. This meant that it would sync all of the tunnels via RPC and
    then wipe them out.
    
    The final issue was that after resetting the tunnel bridge in the
    main loop, the tunnel_sync variable was not set to True, so the
    tunnels would never be resynchronized.
    
    This patch addresses the three issues in the following ways:
    1. Set the failure mode on the bridge before the canary flow is
    installed.
    2. Run the OVS restart logic before the tunnel synchronization.
    3. If the restart logic is triggered, set tunnel_sync to True to
    trigger synchronization.

    don't ignore rules that are already enforced
    
    H302 / H304 are clean in the neutron source tree, so it seems
    like they shouldn't be ignored. This requires no code changes to
    enable.
    
    If there is a longer standing reason for these ignores, would be
    great to document in tox.ini.

    Updated neutron.conf to reflect new RPC options
    
    After oslo.messaging port, some option became unavailable to set, some
    of them changed description or default values. Make sure we don't leave
    anything related to old RPC layer there.
    
    New entries are generated by calling the following from inside
    oslo-incubator:
    
    $ python openstack/common/config/generator.py -l oslo.messaging

    ofagent: move main module from ryu repository
    
    the recent oslo.messaging transition broke ofagent.
    this commit fixes the regression.
    
    historically the main module of ofagent has been maintained
    in ryu's repository.  this commit moves it into neutron's
    repository and add common_config.init() call which is necesary
    for the new rpc code.

    They are treated as strings everywhere. Converting them to int causes problems
    when using postgresql as the database backend because it doesn't automatically

    Use openstack.common.lockutils module for locks in tox functional tests.
    
    Tox test has been switched to use openstack.common.lockutils module
    for interprocess locks. However neutron tox functional tests was
    left behind probably because locking is not required by the existing
    functional test cases. This change makes neutron tox functional tests
    adopt openstack.common.lockutils for locking.

    Revert "ovs-agent: Ensure integration bridge is created"
    
    This reverts commit e5cdad90f97d3a54a493eca19e7a3ff643426de1.
    
    TripleO's multi-node testing shows that this patch caused a failure to receive
    tunnel updates, leading to the first node up to have no agent ports, the second
    to have one agent port, the third to have 2 agent ports, etc. Needless to say,
    this doesn't work all that well :)

    If qos_marking is set to True, the code currently silently

    NSX sync cache: add a flag to skip item deletion
    
    This new flag will prevent updates on single resources, which
    can happen asynchronously to the main synchronization thread,
    from processing the 'changed' flag for items in the cache and
    delete items not present anymore in NSX.
    
    This will avoid failures seen in CI runs where the sync
    thread failed because of a KeyError because some items where
    concurrently removed from the NSX cache.

    Port to oslo.messaging
    
    Now that all preparations are done, actually port the code to use
    oslo.messaging. This patch does as little as possible. Follow up patches
    that refactor and cleanup the code and configuration files, will be
    merged later. The reason for this is to make the patch as slim as
    possible, to make review process more smooth and concentrated.
    
    Details:
    * neutron/common/rpc.py:
      - added init() and cleanup() to set global RPC layer state.
      - added utility functions: get_server(), get_client(), get_notifier()
        that wrap up oslo.messaging API a bit, enforcing eventlet executor
        and setting serializer, among other things.
      - removed PluginRpcDispatcher, instead introduced PluginRpcSerializer
        to use as a default serializer for API callbacks.
    
    * neutron/common/rpc_compat.py:
      - emulated incubator RPC layer behaviour thru previously introduced
        stub classes (RpcCallback, RpcProxy, ...) using new oslo.messaging
        API.
      - switched to using new oslo.messaging exception types.
    
    * neutron/service.py:
      - expect multiple RPC listeners that are of MessageHandlingServer
        type, not GreenThread.
    
    * neutron/common/config.py:
      - initialize RPC layer in init()
    
    * setup.cfg:
      - added entry points for old notifier drivers to retain backward
        compatibility.
    
    * neutron/tests/...:
      - introduced fake_notifier to replace impl_fake.
      - faked out consume_in_thread() to avoid starting RPC listeners when
        running unit tests.
      - used 'fake' transport driver.
      - made sure neutron.test.* exceptions are caught.
      - initialize and clean up RPC layer for each test case.
    
    * Ported all affected code from using neutron.openstack.common.notifier
      API to oslo.messaging.Notifier.
    
    * rpc.set_defaults() was renamed to rpc.set_transport_defaults()
    
    * other changes not worth mentioning here.

    Pass 'top' to remove_rule so that rule matching succeeds
    
    When deleting a vpn-site-connection, deleting the nat rule would
    fail because it was created with top=True, but top defaults to
    'false' in remove_rule and was not being passed. This caused the
    rule matching to fail and the rule to not be deleted.

    Big Switch: Lock consistency table for REST calls
    
    Adds a new class to hold an SQL table lock throughout
    a REST call to prevent servers in an HA deployment from
    using a stale consistency hash value.
    
    Also passes the current context down to the server manager
    for every request since the consistency hash will need to
    be read from the database instead of from a variable on the
    server pool object.

    Big Switch ML2: sync detection in port-update
    
    Adds logic to the update_port_postcommit method of the
    Big Switch ML2 driver to detect when afailure to update
    the port via REST was caused by the backend being out-of-sync
    with neutron.
    
    This was accomplished by checking for the NXNETWORK message
    which indicates that a port request referenced a network that
    does not exist on the backend. This only occurs when they are
    out-of-sync so the driver will then trigger a full topology sync.
    
    The same logic exists in the port creation method shared with
    the Big Switch plugin. However, the Big Switch ML2 driver does
    not send port requests to the controller unless the port binding
    host ID is set, which doesn't occur until a port update after
    binding in the ML2 scenario. Therefore, the logic has to be repeated
    in the ML2 driver port update operation.

    Remove SELECT FOR UPDATE use in ML2 type driver release_segment
    
    SELECT FOR UPDATE expression, which is triggered with the use of the
    SQLAlchemy Query object's with_lockmode('update') method, is
    detrimental to performance and scalability of the database
    performance code in Neutron due to the lock contention it produces.
    
    SELECT FOR UPDATE can be entirely avoided in release_segment methods
    with the use of single-shot UPDATE and DELETE expressions, and this
    patch clears a number of uses of SELECT FOR UPDATE by consolidating
    multiple SQL expressions into one.

    Make sure we call BaseTestCase.setUp() first
    
    Some test cases instantiate RPC clients in setUp() before calling to
    super(). After we port to oslo.messaging, we'll initialize RPC layer in
    BaseTestCase, so we should make sure we call there before proceeding
    with clients in subclasses.

    Don't instantiate RPC clients on import
    
    In oslo.messaging port, we'll need to make sure no RPC clients or
    servers or notifiers are created before RPC layer is initialized using
    n_rpc.init(). This means that there should be no global objects that
    create those objects on __init__.
    
    There should also be no such class attributes because in that case
    import will itself instantiate the object, probably before RPC layer is
    ready.

    Configure agents using neutron.common.config.init (formerly .parse)
    
    After oslo.messaging port is done, we'll need to initialize RPC layer
    from all RPC agents. We'll put initialization into init() function, so
    the first step for migration is to make agents use it.
    
    The function is renamed to be explicit about the fact that we don't just
    parse configuration by calling it, but also do other common
    initializations, like setting RPC layer.

    linuxbridge-agent: process port updates in the main loop
    
    This patch changes the way the linuxbridge agent processes port update
    notifications. It does the same for the lb-agent as was done for the
    ovs-agent in I219c6bdf63b0b5e945b655677f9e28fa591f03cd.
    Now the RPC call just adds the updated tap device name to a set of
    updated devices, and the actual processing is done in the main RPC loop.
    This should solve the problems were port_update RPCs were competing
    with the main loop/greenthread and with each other to do the same task
    - like adding a tap or interface to a bridge - which lead to races and
    was inefficient. Now repeated port_update notifications received within
    a single main loop iteration will be coalesced and processed only once.

    Ensure entries in dnsmasq belong to a subnet using DHCP
    
    In certain configurations, Neutron calculates SLAAC addresses for IPv6
    subnets and adds them to the fixed_ips field of a port. Since those
    subnets are not being managed by DHCP, do not add those fixed_ip entries
    to the host file.

    Trigger provider security group update for RA
    
    For IPv6 subnets, router RA rule is added to compute node
    to allow VM to accept RA from router interface on network node.
    However, currently this is only done when router port which
    sends RA is created *before* VM port is created.
    
    This fix triggers provider security group rule update for IPv6 subnet
    when router interface port is created or updated.

    qos-queue. This patch adds back nvp-qos for trunk chasers and another
    patch will migrate nova from nvp-qos to qos-queue.

    Adding static routes data for members
    
    Adding extra data on member entities for routing.
    Subnet, mask and gateway data is attached to each member.
    Default values are:
     subnet=255.255.255.255
     mask=255.255.255.255
     GW=255.255.255.255
    
    Only in case when LB is connected to both, pool sub-net and vip sub-net
    and member is not on pool's sub-net, routing info will be determined
    instead of setting to default values:
    
    1. In case when member's port is found, member's subnet and mask
       data will be set to those of the port, gateway will be set to pool's
       gateway address
    
    2. In case when no port found or more than one port found for member's IP address,
       member's subnet will be set to member's IP address value , gateway will be set
       to pool's gateway value, and mask will be set to default 255.255.255.255
    
    New unit tests were added for testing following scenarios:
    1. Adding 3 members on 3 different sub-nets, vip's, pool's and other sub-net
    2. Adding member on other than pool's sub-net with no port
    3. Adding member on other than pool's sub-net with multiple ports with same IP address
       but on different sub-nets
    
    Internal vip graph building function was added (_populate_vip_graph)
    for more convenient code re-use and better structure

    When l2-pop ON, clean stale ports in table0 br-tun
    
    When l2-pop is turned ON, the tunnels towards a
    specific node are created and torn down by other nodes,
    based on availability of ports on that specific node in
    specific networks. This generally reclaims the resources
    used for such tunnels in all the nodes.
    
    Under such conditions, in the current code (without this
    fix), the cleaned up ports continue to be present in
    rules of table0 of br-tun, resulting in flow explosion.
    
    This fix adds cleanup-logic to remove such rules that
    continue to use l2-pop cleaned up ports, from table0 of
    br-tun.

    changes ovs agent_id init to use hostname instead of mac
    
    In the Open vSwitch agent,
    the Agent id is currently based off the mac address of the br-int.
    Userspace only Open vSwitch derivatives such as Intel's DPDK
    Accelerated Open vSwitch do not currently create a tap device in the kernel
    to back the ovs bridges local port.
    This limitation prevents reuse of the OpenVSwitch agent between both switches.
    
    To enable reuse of the ovs agent with Intel's DPDK Accelerated Open vSwitch,
    the proposal is to change the  generation of the  agent_id to use the hostname,
    instead of the mac address of the br-int.
    
    For several plugins such as the nec,mlnx,hyperv and onconvergence agents
    the hostname is used to create the agent id.
    Using the hostname will normalise the agent_id between these 5 neutron agents,
    additionally log readability will also be improved,
    if log aggregation is preformed across a cluster
    as it will be easier to identify which node the log is from.
    
    the hostname is retrived from cfg.CONF.host

    Fix race condition with firewall deletion
    
    In some cases when firewall is created and then deleted in short
    period of time, there could be a race condition of firewall status
    changes. Agent may change firewall status from PENDING_DELETE to ACTIVE
    because the agent has just set it up on the backend.
    Delete request then is not properly served and firewall remains in ERROR
    state and can't be deleted at all.
    
    To fix this changing status from PENDING_DELETE is not allowed.
    Deleting firewall in ERROR state is allowed.

    Support Subnets that are configured by external RAs
    
    The IPv6 attributes for subnets provides support for IPv6 subnets that
    are managed by non-OpenStack gateway devices, by creating a subnet that
    has the ipv6_ra_mode attribute not set, and the ipv6_address_mode
    attribute set to IPV6_SLAAC.
    
    In order to support stateless IPv6, Neutron should calculate an IPv6
    address based on the IPv6 prefix and MAC address via EUI-64 specification,
    and assign this address to the port.
    
    Implements blueprint ipv6-provider-nets-slaac

    Refactor code in update_subnet, splitting into individual methods
    
    The update_subnet was already long and complex enough and adding

    I47a3a71d0d196b76eda46b1d960193fb60417ba9

    Make allocation_pools attribute of subnet updateable by PUT
    
    Bug 1111572 was filed about a failed update (PUT) on
    'allocation_pools' of subnet. This is currently not allowed by the
    neutron API (hence DocImpact below). Following discussion on the
    bug and subsequently, it seems this is a desirable feature.
    
    This review makes the allocation_pools attribute of subnet
    updateable by PUT. The semantics are that the entire allocation
    pools attribute is replaced by the provided parameter (see
    provided tests for details).
    
    Unit tests added that exercise successful update of
    allocation_pools with sane params and update using erroneous
    allocation_pools that fall outside the subnet cidr.

    Check NVP router's status before deploying a service
    
    With NVP advanced service plugin, router creation is asynchronous while
    all service call is synchronous, so it is possible that advanced service
    request is called before edge deployment completed.
    The solution is to check the router status before deploying an advanced service.
    If the router is not in ACTIVE status, the service deployment request would return
    "Router not in 'ACTIVE' status" error.

    Remove run-time version checking for openvswitch features
    
    The current method of checking openvswitch and kernel versions for
    specific feature support is brittle, distro-specific and unsupportable.
    
    This patch removes the runtime version checks and implements a test
    script which allows testing specific neutron features or can test
    that all features required by a specific configuration are available.
    
    For example, to test VXLAN support in openvswitch, either:
    
      neutron-sanity-check --ovs_vxlan
    
    or pass in the deployed configuration files with AGENT/tunnel_types
    containing 'vxlan', like:
    
      neutron-sanity-check --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2.conf.ini
    
    Deployment tools can then test that the required features exist without
    relying on version numbers and without incurring a penalty every time
    the agent is started.

    Changed DictModel to dict with attribute access
    
    DictModel is a dict where keys are accessible via attribute access.
    The old version was an object with attributes created from dict keys and many
    attributes where accessible only via getattr because they did not have a valid
    python attribute naming (i.e.: 'provider:network_type' is not a valid
    python variable/attribute name)::
    
        >>> d.provider:network_type
          File "<stdin>", line 1
            d.provider:network_type
                  ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    
    This time we just subclass dict with attribute access to keys.
    
    So dict keys are accessible via attribute access but remain accessible via key
    access::
    
        >>> d = DictModel({'foo': 'bar', 'provider:network_type': 'something'})
        >>> d.foo == d['foo']
        ... True
        >>> getattr(d, 'provider:network_type') == d.get('provider:network_type')
        ... True
        >>> getattr(d, 'provider:network_type') == d['provider:network_type']
        ... True
    
    One of the big advantages when debugging is that now in pdb, pp(d) (where d is
    a DictModel instance) shows a nice dictionary structure, while with the old
    version whe had to perform a "dir(d)" and introspect each attribute...

    Improve iptables_manager _modify_rules() method
    
    As the number of ports per default security group increases, the
    number of iptables entries on the Compute Node grows.  Because of
    this, there is a gradual increase in the time taken to apply chains

    Currently we are using list comprehensions to find if a new chain or
    rule matches an existing one.  Instead, walk through the list in
    reverse to find a matching entry.
    
    Added a new method, _find_last_entry(), to return the entry we are

    Neutron does not follow the RFC 3442 spec for DHCP
    
    When setting a gateway and additional host routes in neutron subnet, the
    gateway is only sent to clients via the router dhcp option, dhcp clients
    conforming to rfc3442 will ignore router option if
    classless-static-routes are available. This patch ensures setting both
    the router option and the classless-static-routes including the gateway

    LBaaS add missing rootwrap filter for route
    
    If one runs the lbaas agent from packages and does not have the l3-agent
    installed on the same box as the lbaas agent it will fail to add the
    default gw route. This is because it's missing the rootwrap filter for
    route which is only present in l3.filters.

    Sync periodic_task from oslo-incubator
    
    This is more or less to get commit c63fd5a from oslo into the core
    projects which have several periodic tasks.  Neutron has periodic tasks
    for L3, load balancing and metering agents to sync up state with the
    server and most don't have specific spacing values set which can lead to
    non-deterministic spacing of when the tasks run.
    
    Note that this does not include the gettextutils and log dependencies
    since there are not functional changes in those modules needed for the
    periodic_task changes synced in *and* more importantly, the changes
    to gettextutils and log require pervasive changes to neutron which
    should happen when neutron integrates with the oslo-i18n library for
    blueprint i18n--messages.
    
    Further note that this does not include jsonutils due to some
    issues introduced with a change for python 2.6 that impacts how strings
    are encoded with simplejson. The details for that issue are in bug
    1314129.  The jsonutils changes are not related to the periodic_task
    changes being synced in so the dependency is not functionally required.
    
    The LbaasAgentManager extends PeriodicTasks but wasn't calling the
    parent class init function, which was causing failures since commit
    47c9d60 changed PeriodicTasks to init _periodic_last_run, so also
    fixed that here.
    
    Changes:
    
    c63fd5a Make unspecified periodic spaced tasks run on default interval
    f0dd798 Remove rendundant parentheses of cfg help strings
    fcf517d Update oslo log messages with translation domains
    051b9f3 Refactor unnecessary arithmetic ops in periodic_task
    674cdaf Refactor if logic in periodic_task
    b6b82c5 Use timestamp in periodic tasks
    47c9d60 Don't share periodic_task instance data in a class attr
    8b2b0b7 Use hacking import_exceptions for gettextutils._

    Reprogram flows when ovs-vswitchd restarts
    
    When OVS is restarted, by default it will not reprogram flows which were
    programmed. For the case of the OVS agent, this means a restart will cause
    all traffic to be switched using the NORMAL action. This is undesirable for
    a number of reasons, including obvious security reasons.
    
    This change provides a way for the agent to check if a restart of ovs-vswitchd
    has happened in the main agent loop. If a restart of ovs-vswitchd is detected,
    the agent will run through the setup of the bridges on the host and reprogram
    flows for all the ports connected.
    
    DocImpact
    This changes adds a new table (table 23) to the integration bridge, with a
    single 'drop' flow. This is used to monitor OVS restarts and to reprogram
    flows from the agent.

    With VXLAN enabled on openvswitch, neutron checks
    module version of the openvswitch kernel module.
    If the pattern to extract the version matches twice
    (eg. for path and version) the agent dies.
    
    This patch ensures, that only the version is checked
    against the pattern.

    Set onlink routes for all subnets on an external network
    
    The addition of the on-link routes gives us some freedom to allocate a
    router's IP address from any one of multiple subnets on one external
    network.  Different routers can get their IPs from different subnets and
    they still have direct on-link connectivity to each other.  For example,
    one router with its primary IP from 10.0.0.0/24 and another from
    192.168.0.0/24 can communicate directly.  It is important that each
    router has on-link routes to *all* of the subnets.
    
    Any router can host floating ips from any of the subnets regardless of
    which subnet the primary IP address comes from.
    
    This is an alternative to the "Multiple floating IP pools" section in
    the administration guide.  It is a simpler alternative that avoids
    having to create multiple external networks.  It is also more flexible
    because routers will no longer be restricted to getting floating IPs
    from the pool to which they happen to be connected.
    
    DocImpact
    Document the procedure for adding subnets to the external network.
    Potentially remove the existing procedure for "Multiple floating IP
    pools" from the docs.

    Allowed Addresspairs: Removing check for overlap with fixed ips
    
    Current code does not allow assigning a fixed ip to a port when that ip
    overlaps with one of the addresses in the allowed-addresspairs list.
    This is an unnecessary check as the overlap does not have any negative
    effect. Further, such a check actually makes it hard to use this
    API. For example, if a fixed IP 10.10.1.1 exists on a port and we
    want to allow addresses in 10.10.1.0/24 cidr on that port, then one
    has to configure a list of 8 cidrs ([10.10.1.0/32, 10.10.1.2/31,
    10.10.1.4/30, ..., 10.10.1.128/25]) on the allowed-addresspairs.
    In addition to the above reasons, the current code also does not
    check for the overlaps in all cases.
    
    This patch summarily removes this overlap check.

    Provide way to reserve dhcp port during failovers
    
    This change provides a way to save the dhcp port when failing
    over a network from one dhcp agent to another.  When a
    dhcp-agent-network-remove is issued, the dhcp port device_id is
    marked as reserved which causes it to not be deleted. When a
    subsequent dhcp-agent-network-add is issued, the reserved port
    is used and the device_id is corrected.  This is desirable
    in order to maintain the dhcp port ip address so that dns doesn't
    get impacted. Unit test added.

    Implement local ARP responder onto OVS agent
    
    With ML2 plugin and l2-pop mechanism driver, it's possible to locally
    answer to the ARP request of the VM and avoid ARP broadcasting emulation
    on overlay which is costly.
    
    When this functionality is enabled, the OVS flows logic evolves to [1].
    This functionality was introduce in 2.1 OVS branch [2].
    
    A README is added to describe l2-pop mechanism driver and the agents
    particularities.

    Also modified tests to include vlan as supported in the
    check_segment().
    
    DocImpact:
    Use of VLANs with ML2 and the OpenDaylight mechanism driver

    Ensure tenant owns devices when creating a gateway
    
    This patch adds an ownership check in the create_gateway method.
    This kind of check can hardly be enforced leveraging the policy engine.

    Fix issubclass() hook behavior in PluginInterface
    
    Currently, PluginInterface provides an issubclass() hook that returns
    True for issubclass(A, B) call, if all abstract methods of B (stored
    in B.__abstractmethods__) can be found in the A.__mro__ tuple of
    classes. But there is an edge case, when B doesn't have any abstract
    methods, which leads to issubclass(A, B) call returning True even if
    A and B are not related all.
    
    E.g. issubclass(NeutronPluginPLUMgridV2, NsxPlugin) returns True,
    while these two are different core plugins. And it gets even more
    trickier when superclasses are involved: e.g. SecurityGroupDbMixin is
    a superclass of NsxPlugin, so depending on the fact whether the
    python module with NsxPlugin class is imported or not,
    issubclass(NeutronPluginPLUMgridV2, SecurityGroupDbMixin) will return
    either False or True accordingly.

    OVS lib defer apply doesn't handle concurrency
    
    The OVS lib deferred apply methods use a dict to save flows to add,
    modify or delete when deffered apply is switched off.
    If another thread adds, modifies or deletes flows on that dict during
    another process called deffered_apply_off, its flows could be ignored.
    
    This fix stash reference flows list and point the flows list to a new
    cleared flows list. Then, it applies flows from the stashed flows list.

    Make plugin deallocation check optional
    
    The fix for memory leakage in the related bug added a check for plugin
    deallocation that performed a call to gc.collect() after every test.
    This had the side-effect of increasing test execution time by ~50%, so
    this patch makes the check optional via an environment variable
    (OS_CHECK_PLUGIN_DEALLOCATION).
    
    It may make sense to create a periodic job that runs with the check
    enabled, but otherwise the check can be used by developers for
    debugging purposes.

    Ensure core plugin deallocation after every test
    
    The unit tests were previously consuming an excessive amount of memory
    (4GB+) due to plugin instances persisting in memory.  Deallocation was
    not possible where a combination of circular references and mocking
    was involved.  This patch ensures that only NeutronManager holds a
    plugin reference and that all other references are instances of
    weakref.proxy.  Residual memory footprint for tox executed on a
    12-core machine has been reduced to ~1.3GB.  Plugin deallocation is
    validated at the end of each test to prevent regressions.
    
    This change also includes fixes to unit tests that depended on plugin
    instances persisting across tests.

    Another patch (commit-id: df96a03e6c74f1fceb4525900bca885307907b79) to
    fix the same issue with less intrusive consequences was already merged
    into master. There's still benefit to have debug logs if this does not
    make gate jobs fail, so revert to previous setting value.

    when DB2 is used as the DB backend of neutron because
    Boolean type is not supported by DB2.
    
    This fix uses "1" instead of "true" in sql when db2 is engine.

    Disable debug messages when running unit tests
    
    Some runs started to fail due to large sub_unit.log files. We should
    reduce their size. The easy way to achieve this is to disable INFO

    Perform policy checks only once on list responses
    
    The policy engine is currently being called for every attribute
    of every resource to be returned by a list response. This is
    harming the API performance; moreover such a high number of checks
    is also unnecessary.
    
    This patch therefore slightly changes the API logic so that list
    response first determine the list of attributes which should be
    returned querying the policy engine and then use this list for
    all resource items to be returned.
    
    To this aim a few methods in base.py needed to be refactored.
    This patch also removes the routine check_if_exists from policy.py
    and the related PolicyNotFound exception.
    
    Finally, this patch also removes unnecessary admin_or_owner rules
    when applied to attributes. This kind of rule indeed has no effect
    anyway because of Neutron's ownership checks. The rules were removed
    because this change won't allow anymore for having attribute-level
    policies whose evaluation result depends on the resource value.
    
    Implements blueprint faster-list-responses

    Record and log reason for dhcp agent resync
    
    A dhcp resync can be triggered at a number of points, but the actual
    resync is done asynchronously by a helper thread.  This means by the
    time the resync happens, it's hard to establish what actually caused
    it.
    
    There have been a number of problems in production systems that cause
    excessive resyncs.  One is a ipv6/dnsmasq issue (rhbz#1077487) and
    another is db corruption with duplicate entries [1].  The resync
    triggers a whole lot of logs itself, so it becomes very unclear how to
    establish any causality.
    
    This change keeps track of what triggered the resync with some helpful
    information.  We add a schedule_resync() function to to replace a
    explicit set of needs_resync which tracks why it was called.
    
    [1] The logs will contain output like "DBDuplicateEntry
    (IntegrityError) (1062, "Duplicate entry
    '6d799c6a-7a09-4c1e-bb63-7d30fd052c8a-d3e3ac5b-9962-428a-a9f8-6b2' for

    Allow test_l3_agent unit test to run individually
    
    When the test_l3_agent.TestL3AgentEventHandler test case is run
    after test discovery it passes because discovery imports files
    that registers all the config options. For the test case to run
    individually we need to explicitly register the config options
    used in the test.

    tests/unit: refactor reading neutron.conf.test
    
    neutron.conf.test includes rpc_backend whose value is stashed.
    Thus it is required to reset when tearing down, otherwise the stale status
    will be used by succeeding tests causing random error.
    
    This patch refactors reading neutron.conf.test and resets the status of
    rpc_backend properly.

    Don't log the error using LOG.error or LOG.exception and then
    passing the same string to SystemExit since this will result in the

    Cisco VPN device driver - support IPSec connection updates
    
    Provides support for IPSec connection updates and state changes. To do
    this, the configuration of the connection is maintained, when the
    connection is created. This is checked against the current settings, at
    sync time, to determine whether a configuration change (as opposed to a
    state change) has occurred.
    
    If there is a change to the configuration detected, then the simple
    approach is taken of deleting and then re-creating the connection, with
    the new settings.
    
    In addition, if the admin state of the connection changes, the tunnel
    will be taken admin down/up, as needed. Admin down will occur if the
    IPSec connection or the associated VPN service is set to admin down.
    Admin up will occur, if both the IPSec connection and the VPN service
    are in admin up state.
    
    Added REST client method to allow changing the IPSec connection tunnel
    to admin up/down (effectively doing a no-shut/shut on the tunnel I/F),
    based on the above mentioned state.
    
    Modified UTs for the support of IPSec connection update requests (used to
    throw an "unsupported" exception), and to check that the configuration
    and state changing are processed correctly.
    
    Updated so that tunnel_ip is set in device driver, rather than hard
    coding, and then overriding in REST client. Since device driver has the
    same info, this will fit into future plans to obtain the info from
    router, vs reading an .ini file. Revised UTs as well.

    NSX: fix migration for networks without a subnet
    
    In case the network is without a subnet, calling the validation
    logic during the report phase leads to an error because the LSN
    would have been already allocated during the migration phase.
    
    Bypass the issue by calling the plugin directly, which is what
    the validation logic does in the first place.

    Allow ML2 plugin test cases to be run independently
    
    Some test cases in neutron.tests.unit.ml2.test_ml2_plugin override the
    network_vlan_ranges option in the ml2_type_vlan config group. However,
    the test module does not import the ML2 type driver module where this
    config group's options are registered. When unit tests are run by
    tox/testr the module is imported during test discovery. Running the
    tests independently via nose or testtools requires the option to be
    explicitly imported.

    Remove List events API from Cisco N1kv Neutron
    
    Earlier Cisco N1kv plugin was using list events api to
    poll policies from VSM.
    It was inefficient and caused delay in processing.
    So, now Cisco N1kv plugin  switched to list profiles to
    poll policies from VSM.

    Replace loopingcall in notifier with a delayed send
    
    The loopingcall thread here was started before processes fork and so
    the thread stops working after the fork call.  This is a problem that
    will probably need to be worked out in the long run.
    
    To ensure that this notifier works correctly in all processes, this
    change replaces the persistent loopingcall thread with a thread
    created on demand to delay and batch up notifications.  The first
    notification will trigger spawning the thread to wait to send it.  Any
    notifications that come in the meantime will notice that there is
    already a thread waiting to send and will return without spawning.

    Add 2-leg configuration to Radware LBaaS Driver
    
    Radware's load balancer currently supports three network interfaces.
    Prior to this code addition, the configuration of those three
    interfaces was: one interface for management, one for high
    availability backup, and one for load balancing servers where the
    IP that the outside world sees (VIP) and the IP that the servers
    respond to (PIP) are identical.
    
    This change adds a new "2-legged" configuration: one interface for
    management, one interface for a VIP network, and one interface for the
    PIP and the high availability backup network.
    
    During VIP creation, the LBaaS driver detects if the incoming
    configuration is "2-legged" by comparing VIP and PIP networks.  If they
    are different it allocates a new port on the PIP network in order to
    obtain an IP address for the PIP and names that port after its
    associated VIP ID.  vDirect is then directed to create a load balancer
    with the PIP network also used as the HA network instead of using the
    vDirect container's default HA network configuration.
    
    During VIP deletion, the LBaas driver detects if a port for the PIP
    had been previously allocated by searching for and deleting port names
    that map to the VIP ID.

    Drop service* tables only if they exist
    
    Tables servicedefinitions and servicetypes are not used by neutron but
    created using db migration tool. If quantum-server in grizzly was
    started without using migration tool then tables mentioned above are not
    created. During migration from grizzly to havana alembic attempts to
    drop these unused tables. This patch uses "IF EXISTS" clause when
    dropping mentioned tables.

    allow delete_port to work when there are multiple floating ips
    
    It is possible to associate multiple floating ip addresses with a single
    port through the use of multiple *fixed* ip addresses, e.g.:
    
        nova boot ... --nic net-id=my-net-id myserver
        nova add-fixed-ip myserver my-net-id
        nova add-floating-ip --fixed-address x.x.x.1 myserver y.y.y.y.1
        nova add-floating-ip --fixed-address x.x.x.2 myserver y.y.y.y.2
    
    In this situation, neutron.db.l3_db.disassociate_floatingips would throw
    an exception:
    
        Exception: Multiple floating IPs found for port <port-id>
    
    This would prevent someone from deleting an instance that was associated
    with multiple floating ips.
    
    This patch corrects disassociate_floatingips so that it will
    disassociate all floating ips associated with the port, allowing the
    delete operation to proceed correctly.

    Previously, neutron had no way to pass a certificates file to the

    you can pass a certificates file to neutronclient in nova.conf via
    neturon_ca_certificates_file.

    This forces the object to be ready ahead of accessing time.
    The change in loading behavior is also beneficial while listing
    routers, as reduces the amount of queries being issued. Tests

    Notifier: Catch NotFound error from nova
    
    If neutron sends a single event to nova and the server_uuid isn't found
    in nova. The python-novaclient will raise a 404 error. This patch ensures
    we explicitly catch that exception and use LOG.warning instead of LOG.exception
    as this is not an error and can happen when deleting an instance if neutron
    detects that the port_status goes down before the port is deleted because
    nova first unplugs the vif and then deletes it from neutron.

    Validate CIDR given as ip-prefix in security-group-rule-create
    
    There was no validation for the provided ip prefix. This just adds
    a simple parse using netaddr and explodes with appropriate message.
    Also makes sure ip prefix _is_ cidr (192.168.1.1-->192.168.1.1/32).
    
    Validation occurs at the attribute level (API model) as well as at
    the db level, where the ethertype is validated against the ip_prefix
    address type.
    
    Unit test cases added - bad prefix, unmasked prefix and incorrect
    ethertype. Also adds attribute test cases for the added
    convert_ip_prefix_to_cidr method

    Support enhancements to Cisco CSR VPN REST APIs
    
    Incorporate latest enhancements and fixes in Cisco CSR router REST API
    to the VPNaaS device driver and unit test cases. Primarily, is support in
    the REST API for different IKE and IPSec encryption algorithms, name length
    error handling, disable of anti replay window, and IKE keep alive.
    
    Also includes minor typos and comment fixes mentioned in previous reviews.
    
    Note: notest_cisco_csr_rest.py, which tests the CSR REST client, is not
    part of the UT suite yet, pending resolution of httmock package inclusion
    as test requirement.

    Nuage Plugin: Delete router requires precommit checks
    
    There exist a case where deleting router from neutron without
    deleting router-interface deletes router from VSD but not from neutron.
    If router has an interface with subnet router deletion is not allowed.
    Needs to precheck this condition before deleting router from
    backend (VSD).

    Delete DHCP port without DHCP server on a net node
    
    A DHCP-network was deleted from one host using neutron
    dhcp-agent-network-remove and then added to another host
    using neutron dhcp-agent-network-add command. While the
    dhcp-agent-network-remove command was in progress, the
    host crashed.  As a result, the removal of the DHCP-network
    was partially done. The network was disassociated from
    the agent in mysql. However, the agent never made the
    release_dhcp_port RPC call to delete the port -- even
    after the agent restarted. The end result is that there
    are two DHCP ports for the same network. One of these
    is found on the host that is no longer hosting the
    dhcp-server.
    
    This fix make the DHCP agent invoke the release_dhcp_port
    RPC call on a stale network whose dnsmasq process is not
    running (not active). Before this change, the RPC call is
    made on a stale network only when the dnsmasq process is
    running.

    Make default nova_url use a version
    
    The default nova_url for neutron is missing an API
    version number. This can cause requests to fail
    because the Nova /versions API cannot respond
    to Neutron notification requests.
    
    It seems reasonable for the default value to
    at least have a chance at being correct so
    this patch upgrades the default Nova API url to
    use the Nova 'v2' API.

    Update ensure()/reconnect() to catch MessagingError
    
    The error handling code that gets connections reset if necessary
    caught ConnectionError. It really needs to catch MessagingError,
    which ConnectionError inherits from. There are other types of
    MessagingErrors that may occur, such as InternalError, and they need
    to cause the connection to reset, as well.
    
    This fix has already been merged into oslo.messaging.

    NSX: Fix KeyError in sync if nsx_router_id not found
    
    Previously, a KeyError would occur in the sync code which would
    cause the sync thread to stop running. This would occur if there
    was a router entry in the database but no nsx_router_mapping and
    the router was not found in nsx. Note: this should never happen unless
    one did not run the db migration which introduced and migrated the data
    for the NeutronNsxRouterMapping table.

    BigSwitch: Create router ports synchronously
    
    Since router ports are created as part of a
    long transaction with multiple REST calls, they
    need to be created sychronously. This is to prevent
    the async thread from deleting them from the backend
    if it can't find them in cases where they haven't been
    committed to the DB yet.

    BSN: Remove module-level ref to httplib method
    
    Removes a module-level variable that was just a
    pointer to the httplib.HTTPConnection class. It's
    purpose was to give mock.patch a target that wouldn't
    affect other code using the httplib.HTTPConnection
    library. However, it is unnecessary now that the
    root cause of the original patches not being stopped
    by mock.patch.stopall was fixed in bug 1303605 (change
    Ia5b374c5f8d3a7905d915de4f1f8d4f3a6f0e58d).

    BigSwitch: Stop HTTP patch before overriding
    
    Stops the default HTTPConnection patch used by the
    Big Switch tests before patching HTTPConnection with
    another substitution. This prevents mock from losing
    track of the default patch which was resulting in it
    not consistently being stopped by the stopall call in
    cleanup.
    
    This also corrects an incorrectly targeted mock for the
    HTTP patch in one of the test files.

    set api.extensions logging to ERROR in unit tests
    
    neutron.api.extensions generates a lot of output in a normal
    unit test run. It's responsible for > 80% of the lines in the
    subunit_log.txt. Logging each file load 10k times slows everything
    down, takes up valuable memory, and doesn't really help with testing.
    
    Instead we can set this to ERROR level in a fixture to ignore most
    of that logging and help make the unit tests run faster.

    Remove RPC to plugin when dhcp sets default route
    
    _set_default_route() was using an RPC to the plugin to get the DHCP
    port for the network on the current host, and then used it to form
    the tap device name. This happened on every allocation reload too.
    This fix removes the RPC and gets the tap device name using local
    methods instead. It also removes an unnecessary call to set the
    default route in the restart method.

    BigSwitch: Don't import portbindings_db until use
    
    The Big Switch ML2 driver re-uses large parts of
    code from the Big Switch plugin. However, the plugin
    uses the old portbindings_db in its port tracking
    code. This db is not created/used by ML2, so it does
    not exist when the Big Switch ML2 driver is being used.
    This caused a problem when the portbindings_db module
    would be imported even though it wasn't being used
    since the SQLAlchemy models would create the
    relationships during the import.
    
    This patch moves the portbindings_db import down to
    the methods that leverage it so it won't be imported
    during use by the ML2 driver.
    
    This is a temporary solution which can be back-ported
    if disabling auto schema generation is back-ported
    to icehouse. An appropriate fix will require some
    refactoring to avoid the port tracking code from
    being imported for ML2.

    Clean out namespaces even if we don't delete namespaces
    
    Even when we don't enable namespace deletion, we still want to run the
    code that cleans out the namespaces so that the devices get unplugged,
    etc.  Otherwise, routers deleted while the agent is down will continue
    to operate as if they were never deleted.
    
    The trade-off to consider here is that if there are many stale
    namespaces this will slow down the restart of the L3 agent.  The best
    option is to get namespace deletion working correctly.  However, where
    that has not been worked out yet, this patch provides the cleaning
    service for deleted routers.

    The OpenDaylight mechanism driver does not depend on an L2 agent to
    plug the port. Now that nova waits for notification that the port
    status is ACTIVE, the ML2 driver API is extended so that the mechanism
    driver that binds a port can optionally set the port status, and the
    OpenDaylight mechanism driver uses this to set the port status to

    Delete routers that are requested but not reported as active
    
    There are two cases that I can think of that result in a router being
    requested but not reported as active.  One is that admin_state_up has
    been set to False.  In this case, the router is never removed and
    continues to be operational.
    
    The other case is if a router is changed and then deleted before the
    change is processed.  In this case, it is prudent to be sure that the
    router is queued for deletion.

    A few tests were using mock's called_once, or called_once_with_args
    instead of assert_called_once or assert_called_once_with_args. Those
    methods return a bool that needs to be actively checked.
    
    The tests are fixed to avoid them from passing if the call condition
    is not met.

    fixes broken neutron-netns-cleanup
    
    Some configuration parameters used in neutron.agent.linux.utils
    were missing. The namespace attribute in the FakeNetwork object
    was missing, and used in neutron.agent.linux.dhcp. Also, the
    plugin object was missing for release_dhcp_port operation.
    
    We provide a fake plugin object to accept current and any future
    plugin calls as this is meant to be an standalone tool that
    should work without any RPC connectivity.
    
    FakeNetwork was switched for neutron.agent.linux.dhcp.NetModel
    to follow any future changes in NetModel.
    
    Two wrong called_once_with_args calls without assert were fixed.

    Permit ICMPv6 RAs only from known routers
    
    Currently ingress ICMPv6 RAs are permitted from any IPs by
    default to allow VMs to accept ICMPv6 RA from provider network.
    In this way, VM can accept RAs from attacker VM and configure
    a network prefix specified by the attacher VM.
    
    Remove permitting ICMPv6 RAs from any IPs and add security rule
    to only permit ICMPv6 RA from:
    
    1. If the port's subnet is configured with ipv6_ra_mode value
    (i.e.value is slaac, dhcpv6-stateful, or dhcpv6-stateless), RA
    is sending from dnsmasq controlled by OpenStack. In this case,
    allow RA from the link local address of gateway port (if the
    gateway port is created).
    
    2. If the subnet's gateway port is not managed by OpenStack, allow
    the ICMPv6 RA sent from the subnet gateway IP if it's a link local
    address. The administrator needs to configure the gateway IP as
    link local address in this case to make the RA rule work.

    OFA agent: use hexadecimal IP address in tunnel port name
    
    The remote IP address is used to form the tunnel port name
    With some OVS/Linux combinations there is a 15 character limit
    on port names, so a name like 'gre-192.168.10.10' does not work.
    This fix uses the shorter hexadecimal representation of
    the IP address instead.
    This problem was reported and fixed for OVS agent.

    Stop using portbindings_db in BSN ML2 driver
    
    Avoids using the portbindings_db in the Big Switch
    ML2 driver since ML2 has deprecated that database for
    its own version that tracks the same information.
    
    Also eliminates unnecessary 'binding_host' field since
    it is now always the same as as the 'portbinding:host_id'

    Only send notifications on uuid device_id's
    
    Neutron assumes that all ports with the device_owner that start with
    'compute:' are ports created by nova compute. Thus, when the debug agent
    creates a port with device_owner = compute:probe the nova notifier
    feature tells nova when this port is wired even though nova does not know
    about it (doesn't really matter we just log an error). This patch adds a check
    to make sure the device_id is a uuid as nova only uses uuids and the debug
    agent uses the hostname for device_id.

    Cancelling thread start while unit tests running
    
    This change modifies the Radware driver and its unit testing code
    to not start operations completion thread while unit tests are running.
    
    The driver initialization changed not to start the operations completion thread,
    the thread is started only when operation completion item is inserted into the queue
    for the first time.
    The operation completion functionality was moved to a new function which
    is called by the operations completion thread run() function.
    The run() function still have the functionality of popping operation completion
    items out of the queue and push failed items back.
    
    Unit testing code mocks the operation completion items queue
    by calling the operations completion hanler new function when item
    is added.
    
    Start() and join() functions of the thread were mocked to do nothing.
    
    All sleep() entrances were removed from the unit testing code.
    All unnecessary mock_reset() calls were removed.

    Deals with fails in update_*_postcommit ops
    
    It makes all mechanism drivers called even when one
    of the mechanism drivers fails during a post commit
    operation for updating network/subnet/port. This is
    a stopgap measure until a more comprehensive approach
    is adopted and implemented.

    UT: do not hide an original error in test resource ctxtmgr
    
    In unit tests, resource contextmanagers such as network(), subnet()
    try to delete themselves after returning from yield even if an
    exception occurs. However when an exception occurs, there is a case
    where deletion fails. In this case original exception will be hidden
    and it makes difficult to debug test failures.
    
    Before each test starts, resources like database entries will be
    recreated, so there is no need to try to delete resources even
    when an exception occurs. This commit removes try-finally clause
    from resource contextmanagers to make original errors visible.

    Make dnsmasq aware of all names
    
    Each dnsmasq instance on a network is not aware of other dnsmasq's leases.
    
    When dnsmasq is launched with --no-hosts and is not provided an --addn-hosts
    file, it can resolve only the hosts to which it gives a dhcp lease and no more.
    i.e.:
    If dnsmasq service n°1 gives a lease to instance n°1, and dnsmasq service n°2
    gives a lease to instance n°2, both VM instances and dnsmasq services being on
    the same network: instance n°1 can not resolve instance n°2, because instance
    n°1 queries dnsmasq n°1, and since it did not give the lease to instance n°2,
    it can not resolve it (it is not aware of its existence). Same issue if
    instance n°2 tries to resolve instance n°1.
    
    The solution is to provide dnsmasq with an --addn-hosts file of all hosts on
    the network. With an --addn-hosts file, each dnsmasq instance is aware of all
    the hosts on the network even if they do not give the lease for a host,
    therefore each dnsmasq instance can resolve any host on their network even if
    they did not provide the lease for it themselves.

    Prevent cross plugging router ports from other tenants
    
    Previously, a tenant could plug an interface into another tenant's
    router if he knew their router_id by creating a port with the correct
    device_id and device_owner. This patch prevents this from occuring
    by preventing non-admin users from creating ports with device_owner
    network:router_interface with a device_id that matches another tenants router.
    In addition, it prevents one from updating a ports device_owner and device_id
    so that the device_id won't match another tenants router with device_owner
    being network:router_interface.
    
    NOTE: with this change it does open up the possiblity for a tenant to discover
    router_id's of another tenant's by guessing them and updating a port till
    a conflict occurs. That said, randomly guessing the router id would be hard
    and in theory should not matter if exposed. We also need to allow a tenant
    to update the device_id on network:router_interface ports as this would be
    used for by anyone using a vm as a service router. This issue will be fixed in
    another patch upstream as a db migration is required but since this needs
    to be backported to all stable branches this is not possible.
    
    NOTE: The only plugins affect by this are the ones that use the l3-agent.
    
    NOTE: **One should perform and audit of the ports that are already
            attached to routers after applying this patch and remove ports
            that a tenant may have cross plugged.**

    Subnets should be set as lazy='join'
    
    Currently if one does a net-list tons of queries are issued against the
    database as the default query mode is 'select' which performs a query when
    the field is actually accessed. In this patch I change the the mode to
    'joined' so subnets are loaded as the networks are loaded. Usually, there
    are only 1 or 2 subnets on a network so loading this data shouldn't hurt.
    This patch in my setup with 5000 networks reduces the net-list call from 27
    seconds to 7! Woot Woot :)

    Import request_id middleware bug fix from oslo
    
    There is a bug in request-id middleware that a subsequent API request will
    overwrite a request-id of a previous request when multiple API calls are
    processed in parallel in request_id middleware.
    This commit imports the fix in oslo.
    
    cherry-picked from oslo-incubator d7bd9dc37ac3d6bc171cd2e290c772633ad20a32
    Closes-Bug: #1289696
    ----
    Don't store the request ID value in middleware as class variable
    
    The original version of the request_id middleware generates a request ID during
    process_request() and stores the value in a variable, so it can be attached as
    header in process_request(). This is pretty dangerous, since subsequent
    requests will overwrite this value, and the wrong request ID may be attached to
    some responses. This is particularly apparent when requests arrive in parallel.
    
    This change replaces process_request() and process_response() with an override
    of __call__(). This allows the generated req_id to be used in the response
    header without needing to save it as a class-level variable.

    Depends on reference implementation change (81124 review) that will pass VPN
    service admin up/down changes to the service driver (for subsequent passing
    to the device driver).
    
    This change will save the runtime state of the IPSec connections that have
    been removed due to a VPN service down change, so that this can be reported
    to the plugin properly. Otherwise, without the change, there is no info
    on the downed connection and no change report so the plugin thinks the
    connection is still active.
    
    In addition, the status for the VPN service will reflect whether there are
    any IPSec connections ACTIVE. If one or more are acive, the service will
    be active, otherwise it will be DOWN.
    
    Updated UT to add tests for admin state and status reporting. Also changed
    some IPSec create UTs because they were not cleaning up correctly upon test
    failures (only seen with a live CSR).
    
    In the future, when the Cisco CSR REST API supports admin up/down support,
    the IPSec connections will not be deleted, but instead will be shut down, in
    response to an admin down event (and then brought up, for admin up). During
    the down time, the state will be reported correctly and no run-time state
    recording needed.

    Add script to migrate ovs or lb db to ml2 db
    
    This script migrates an ovs or lb database to work with ml2.
    The script's docstring provides details as to how it is intended to
    work.
    
    I've tested this manually on a trivial deployment, and would like
    to add support for testing the migration with grenade.  However,
    that will have to wait until grenade support for neutron has
    merged.

    LBaaS: make device driver decide whether to deploy instance
    
    Currently server throws an error in case agent (device driver)
    requests logical config for non-active pool, which is a bug
    as it's ok if pool is in pending create/update states.
    Also the pool may be already scheduled for delete (pending_delete)
    while agent requests it to perform some previous update, which
    as also ok and agent just doesn't deploy such config.
    
    This patch moves active pool check from server side to agent side

    NSX plugin: return 400 for invalid gw certificate
    
    Gateway certificates are validated by the NSX backend.
    The code currently treats a failure in certification
    validation as a backend failure and therefore returns
    a 500 status code.
    
    This patch changes this behaviour by returning a 400
    status code and an appropriate error description.
    To this aim a handler for 400 errors has been added to
    the NSX API client.

    NEC plugin: Remove a colon from binding:profile key due to XML problem
    
    In XML specification, if a tag name contains a colon, a part before
    a colon is interpreted as namespace. If key names in binding:profile
    dict contains a colon, Neutron XML serializer sends them as-is.
    A colon in key names should be used only if XML namespace are used.
    NEC plugin uses a colon in key names and it leads to failures to XML
    deserialization. To avoid this problem, this commit removes a colon
    and prefix n key names in port binding:profile so that client XML
    deserializer decodes XML response successfully.

    Return meaningful error message on pool creation error
    
    Instead of returning exception specific to haproxy (agent-based),
    return more generic BackendNotFound exception.
    It also could be used later when binding to devices will be

    Don't set priority when calling mod_flow
    
    This commit [1] changed the behavior of modifying flows to not allow priority
    to be set on flow modification. The agent code which was calling mod_flow was
    not updated to respect this behavior. The unit tests were also not updated in
    this regard. I've corrected this behavior now, and added a negative UT case to
    catch this in the future.

    ML2: Remove validate_port_binding() and unbind_port()
    
    The API implemented by ML2 mechanism drivers included three methods
    related to port binding that were called within DB transactions, but
    that could potentially involve communication with controllers or
    devices that should not be done within transactions. A subsequent
    patch will move the calls to bind_port() outside of tranactions. This
    patch eliminates the other two methods from the MechanismDriver API.
    
    The validate_port_binding() method was previously called on the bound
    mechanism driver to check whether an existing binding was still valid,
    so that the port could be rebound if something changed. But since nova
    has no way to handle changes to binding:vif_type or
    binding:vif_details after a port is initially plugged, this turned out
    not to be useful, so the method has been removed from the
    MechanismDriver API. Now, once a port is successfully bound, the
    binding remains until the port is deleted or any of it's
    binding:host_id, binding:vnic_type, or binding:profile attribute
    values are changed.
    
    The unbind_port() method was previously called on the bound mechanism
    driver as an existing binding was removed. This method was not used by
    any existing mechanism drivers, and was redundant with the
    update_port_precommit() and update_port_postcommit() methods that are
    called on all mechanism drivers when an existing binding is removed,
    so this method has also been removed from the driver API.
    
    Eliminating the unbind_port() call allows the binding details to be
    made available via the PortContext in delete_port_postcommit() calls,
    completing the resolution of bug 1276395.

    Add a semaphore to some ML2 operations
    
    This patch adds a semaphore for serializing the delete port API
    calls and update_port_status calls to avoid simultaneous
    attempts to acquire SQL update locks on the port table from
    the same thread pool.
    
    This semaphore has been introduced to avoid undesired eventlet
    yields which trigger 'lock wait timeout' errors in the DB backend;
    it should have a negligible impact on the overall performance.

    Log dnsmasq host file generation
    
    We've been seeing things that appear to be races between the hosts
    files being written out for dnsmasq and dhcp requests coming in.  We
    will get occasional errors from dnsmasq saying "no address available",
    "duplicate IP address" but by the time you look, the corresponding
    host file has long since been replaced.
    
    If we had some debugging like this, we could at least correlate what
    neutron thought dnsmasq knew at the time the requests were coming in.
    
    We store the filename to avoid multiple lookups, and also
    s/name/filename/ to avoid ambiguity and be more consistent with the

    This change wraps the command to generate a migration with code to
    update a file called HEAD. The HEAD file will contain the revision ID
    of the head of the migraton timeline. Additionally, check migrations has
    been altered to verify the contents of this file against the timeline
    head.
    
    This file helps the OpenStack gate detect potential migration branches

    Cisco VPN device driver post-merge cleanup
    
    During review for I-3 there were some minor comments regarding log
    level on message and asserts for mock calls.
    
    In addition, some debug logging enhancements were made between the
    service and device driver to better indicate the source of the
    shared "vpnservice_updated" RPC.
    
    Lastly, unit tests were updated, based on a newer Cisco CSR image,
    which had REST API fixes and behavior changes.

    Enable to select an RPC handling plugin under Metaplugin
    
    Multiple plugins under metaplugin become 'q-plugin' topic
    consumers and a request from an agent is handled by one of
    them randomly. Fortunatly most of RPC callbacks are common
    for plugins but a problem occurs if an RPC is not supported
    by the received plugin.
    
    This is one of risks when using metaplugin. Fundamental fix
    of this problem (such as RPC delegation handling of metaplugin)
    is difficult since each plugin needs to modify.
    But when only one plugin has plugin specific RPCs and other
    RPCs are independet of plugins, if the plugin can be selected
    for RPC handling, the problem does not happen. Typical use
    case of metaplugin such as combination of an agent-based
    plugin and a controller-based plugin often applies to this
    condition.
    
    This patch adds 'rpc_flavor' configuration parameter to
    select an RPC handling plugin. If 'rpc_flavor' is specified,
    only the specified plugin becomes 'q-plugin' topic consumer.
    If 'rpc_flavor' is not specified, the behavior is same as
    previous one.

    Cisco plugin fails with ParseError no elem found
    
    When the Cisco nexus plugin is configured on DevStack, the tempest
    Neutron API test test_port_list_filter_by_router_id fails with the
    following error:
         ParseError: no element found: line 1, column 0
    
    The root cause is that the Cisco Nexus plugin model layer
    is encapsulating each dictionary response from the OVS subplugin
    into a list, whereas the WSGI layer is expecting a dictionary
    response. The fix is not to encapsulate these responses into a list.

    Cisco Nexus: maximum recursion error in ConnectionContext.__del__
    
    If DevStack is configured for the Cisco Nexus plugin, the following
    error is observed:
    
    Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded' in <bound
    method ConnectionContext.__del__ of
    <neutron.openstack.common.rpc.amqp.ConnectionContext object at
    0x403a3d0>> ignored
    
    The root cause of the problem is that the Cisco Nexus plugin's
    PluginV2.__gettattr__ method, a model object is being passed
    as a value for a unicode %s format mod. Because the neutron server
    has "lazy gettext" (deferred interpretation of unicode objects) enabled,
    this causes many layers of recursive calls to deepcopy.
    
    The fix is to pass a string object for the unicode %s mod field.

    Change report_interval from 4 to 30, agent_down_time from 9 to 75
    
    report_interval is how often an agent sends out a heartbeat to the
    service. The Neutron service responds to these 'report_state' RPC
    messages by updating the agent's heartbeat DB record.
    The last heartbeat is then compared to the configured
    agent_down_time to determine if the agent is up or down.
    The agent's status is used when scheduling networks on DHCP
    and L3 agents.
    
    In the spirit of sane defaults suited for production, these values
    should be bumped to reduce the load on the Neutron service
    dramatically, freeing up CPU time to perform intensive operations.

    Fix misleading error message about failed dhcp notifications
    
    This is achieved by adjusting the log traces and ensuring
    that the right log errors are emitted based on the status
    of the network.
    
    Also, the patch drastically simplifies the structure of the
    notification method and unit tests to increase coverage.

    NSX: Fix router-interface-delete returns 404 when router not in nsx
    
    Previously, if one would run router-interface-delete and the router
    was not found in NSX. Neutron would raise a 404 error and remove the interface
    from the database. In this case it would be better if we did not raise
    a 404 error as the caller shouldn't be aware that the backend is out of sync.

    Fix _validate_mac_address method
    
    The method _validate_mac_address previously used: netaddr.EUI(data)
    which would convert data passed in to the correct mac_address representation.
    For example if data=123 it would return: EUI('00-00-00-00-00-7B'). To fix
    this issue I used netaddr.valid_mac() instead which returns a bool if a mac is
    valid or not and does not raise. Note this file needs some improvements to
    improve how exception handling is done that will come later.

    Create new IPv6 attributes for Subnets
    
    * Introduces two new optional attributes for Subnets:
      * ipv6_ra_mode
      * ipv6_address_mode
    
    Both attributes accept the following values:
    
    * dhcpv6-stateful
    * dhcpv6-stateless
    * slaac
    
    In addition to these values, additional behaviors are specified for
    when only one of the attributes is set. For example, a Neutron network
    that uses a physical router as a gateway, that transmits ICMPv6 Router
    Advertisement packets to configure hosts on the network will create
    Neutron Subnets that have ipv6_ra_mode *not* set, and ipv6_address_mode
    set to 'slaac' so that Neutron will calculate EUI64 addresses for
    each port assigned to the subnet, and not spawn a Dnsmasq process.
    
    These attributes maintain backwards compatability with the enable_dhcp
    Subnet attribute, by requiring a subnet with these attributes to also
    have enable_dhcp set to True.

    NSX: Ensure gateway devices are usable after upgrade
    
    The gateway device database migration upon an upgrade creates
    gateway devices objects from references in network gateway
    objects.
    While these gateway devices are perfectly usable
    in network gateways, they are not directly visible to tenants
    and also cannot be updated to change details such as name,
    connector type or ip as well as the client certificate.
    
    This patch fixes the DB migration in order to ensure tenant
    have access to gateway devices created after an upgrade.
    This patch also modifies the l2 gateway nsxlib module to
    ensure request bodies are correctly created even when not all
    the attributes of a gateway device are specified.

    Process ICMP type for iptables firewall
    
    In current security group code, source_port_range_min
    and source_port_range_max are used to specify icmp type
    and code when security group rule protocol is icmp.
    However, the code _port_arg in iptables_firewall called
    by _convert_sgr_to_iptables_rules skips protocol icmp
    when processing the arg. This happens to both ipv4 and
    ipv6 icmp firewall rules.
    
    This fix adds --icmp-type to iptables firewall rule when
    icmp type is specified.

    Avoid long transaction in plugin.delete_ports()
    
    db_plugin.delete_ports() called plugin.delete_port() under
    a transaction. It leads to long transaction if plugin.delete_port
    talks with external systems. This commit changes each delete_port
    outside of a transaction to avoid longer transaction.
    
    plugin.delete_ports is now called by release_dhcp_ports and
    dhcp-agent ports can be deleted separately, so this changes
    does not break the existing behavior.
    
    delete_ports is renamed to delete_ports_by_device_id
    to clarify the usage of this method.
    
    NEC plugin already has this change and it is no longer needed.
    
    _do_side_effect helper method in test_db_plugin is renamed
    to more self-descriptive name.

    Fix KeyError except on router_info in FW Agent
    
    The workflow of creating a firewall when a router without any i/f is present in that tenant
    causes a KeyError on the FWAgent. The issue occurs as such routers are present in the list of
    routers returned by get_routers() but are not populated in the router_info dict. Adding a check
    before accessing the dict to prevent the exception. When an i/f is added to such routers -
    _router_added processing in the l3agent will populate the router_info dict and the FWAgent
    also picks this up in that context.

    Bugfix and refactoring for ovs_lib flow methods
    
    Remove hardcoded flow parameters from
    '_build_flow_expr_str' method, so we can
    define any flows we want and can rely on 'ovs-ofctl'
    command to verify flow arguments correctness.
    When building flow string inside _build_flow_expr_str
    use the following approach:
    1. Build prefix and remove prefix params from flow_dict.
    2. Build postfix (actions) and remove 'actions' from
    flow dict.
    3. Inside the loop build flow array from everything
    what's left in flow_dict.
    4. Append postfix (actions) to the flow array.
    5. 'Join' flow array into flow string.
    
    Change _build_flow_expr_str() to be a function
    instead of an object method because 'self'
    parameter  wasn't used.
    
    Remove 'add_or_mod_flow_str' method because
    we have to use separate logic when bulding flow
    strings for 'add_flow' and 'mod_flow' methods.
    
    Add more unit tests for OVSBridge class.

    send a get_device_details which means that it owns
    the migrated port. The fdb_add message will be sent
    as soon as the new host send update_device_up

    Notify nova when ports are ready
    
    The following patch adds a callback from neutron to nova that notifies nova
    when a port for an instance is *ready to be used*. After nova receives this
    event it will then start the instance in a hope that when it comes up
    its networking should be in working order.
    
    NOTE: *ready to be used* currently means that a plugin changes the status
    in the db associated with a port from:
    NO_VALUE/PORT_STATUS_DOWN/PORT_STATUS_ACTIVE to ACTIVE/ERROR.
    
    Neutron will then signal nova: network_vif_plugged:<status> where status
    will either be 'completed' or 'failed' given the neutron port status.
    
    Neutron also notifies nova when a port goes from status:
    PORT_STATUS_ACTIVE to PORT_STATUS_DOWN and sends nova a network_vif_unplugged
    event.
    
    Currently this patch breaks multiregion support (i.e previously you could
    back multiple nova regions by one neutron server) though now since neutron
    needs to notify nova we'll need to add a way to determine which region a
    given port is in.
    
    For now the work around for this would be to set: notify_nova_port_active=False
    in neutron to prevent neutron from sending the notification and setting:
    vif_plugging_is_fatal=False in nova.conf. Doing this will keep the current
    interaction where an instance will be booted without waiting for the network
    to be ready.
    
    DocImpact
    
    implements blueprint: nova-event-callback

    VPNaaS Device Driver for Cisco CSR
    
    This is the device driver for the vendor specific VPNaaS plugin. This
    change relies on the service driver code (review 74144), which is also
    out for review.
    
    Note: Support for sharing of IKE/IPSec policies (which is currently
          prevented by the service driver code), will be done as a later
          enhancement.
    Note: Needs Tempest tests updated/created to test this.
    Note: To run, this needs an out-of-band Cisco CSR installed and
          configured.
    Note: This uses a newer version of requests library and a new httmock
          library. Until these are approved (75296), the UT will be
          renamed to prevent testing the REST client API to the CSR.

    Fixing lost vlan ids on interfaces
    
    Sometimes a vm gets its tap interface unset and reset too fast to be caught in
    an agent loop, and its vlan tag was not reset.
    
    We now detect if an interface loses its vlan tag, and if it happens the
    interface will be reconfigured.
    
    Since the TAG ID is only available via the "Port" table (in the 'tag' column),

    in python3.x, there is no method named xrange(),
    it has replaced by range(),which is equal to xrange() in python2.x.
    so we must fix this issue.we use six module to fix this issue.

    Call target plugin out of DB transaction in the Metaplugin
    
    Previously, there are cases that a target plugin is called
    within a DB transaction in the metaplugin. This possibly causes
    "DB lock timeout" error since a target plugin may take a long
    time (ex. communicate to a controller).

    NSX: Sync do not pass around model object
    
    The NSX sync backend previously passed around a sqlalchemy model object
    around which was nice because we did not need to query the database an
    additional time to update the status of an object.
    
    Unfortunately, this was add done within a db transaction which included a
    call to NSX which could cause deadlock this needed to be removed. Now a
    dict is passed around instead and proper transaction handling
    is used when updating objects.

    Fix lack of extended port's attributes in Metaplugin
    
    Previously, there are some extended port's attributes did not
    appear in the result of GET port API when using Metaplugin.
    This become a critial issue currently since lack of port binding
    information disturbs normal port binding operation in a compute
    node, for example.
    
    Metaplugin did not delegate get_port/get_ports to target plugins.
    This is cause of the problem because right plugin instance is not
    passed to a hook which handles extended attributes.
    Now, get_port/get_ports of target plugins are called so that
    extended port's attributes are handled properly.

    Add support for tenant-provided NSX gateways devices
    
    Add a new API resource specific to the NSX plugin for registering
    tenant-owned NSX gateway devices with the NSX controller.
    This API also allows tenants for managing gateway devices on the
    NSX backend.
    
    The behaviour of the net-gateway extension is mostly unchanged with
    the only difference that newly created network gateways can now only
    refer exlusively gateway devices registered using the API resource
    introduced with this patch.

    Nuage plugin was missed in floatingip_status db migration script
    
    The fix for bug 1287630 did not include the the Nuage plugin
    in those affected by the migration.
    Nuage CI started failing floatingip tests since than
    reporting unknown column error.
    This bug fix is to add nuage plugin to the list.

    Makes the Extension loader behavior predictable
    
    When using a cluster of load-balanced Neutron Servers,
    the order of extension files being loaded may differ
    from one server to another. This is usually harmless,
    but it is better to force the list to be loaded in the
    same way across the entire cluster, just in case
    something funky is going on.

    One Convergence Neutron Plugin Implementation
    
    One Convergence Neutron Plugin implements Neutron API to provide a network
    virtualization solution. The plugin works with One Convergence NVSD controller
    to provide the functionality. This checkin implements the Neutron core APIs
    and the plugin will be extended to support the L3 and service plugin extension
    APIs.

    NEC plugin: delete old OFC ID mapping tables
    
    Before Grizzly release, data format of OFC ID mapping tables was changed
    and there are two types of ID mapping tables for old and new format.
    This commit migrate data from old mapping tables into new tables,
    drop old mapping tables and remove the logic handling the old tables.
    
    In the db migration scripts, built-in compiler of sqlalchemy does not
    support "INSERT INTO table (col1, col2,...) (SELECT ....)" format,
    so a custom sqlalchemy.expression compiling method is defined.

    BigSwitch: Auto re-sync on backend inconsistencies
    
    If the controller supports it, pass a hash to the
    controller indicating the expected state that a
    REST transaction is updating. If the state is
    inconsistent, the controller will return an error
    indicating a conflict and the plugin/driver will
    trigger a full synchronization.
    
    For controllers that don't support the consistency
    hash, trigger a full background synchronization
    if the plugin tries to create a port and receives
    a 404 error due to the parent network not existing.

    VPNaaS Service Driver for Cisco CSR
    
    This has the service driver part of the vendor specific VPNaaS plugin.
    This version DOES NOT rely on the Service Type Framework code, which is
    presently under review (client 53602, server 41827) and on hold due to
    discussion over flavors. As a result, this changeset has modifications
    so that the service driver is not hard-coded in the VPN plugin.
    
    The device driver will be under a separate review and has the REST
    client that talks to the Cisco CSR (running out-of-band).
    
    Note: See review 74156 for more details on device driver portion of
          this blueprint.

    version is higher than 3.8 or even 3.11, its vxlan mod may be
    disabled. Under both situation, vxlan enablement checking via linux
    kernel version may not be correct.

    NSX: passing wrong security_group id mapping to nsx backend
    
    When the async secgroup work was added the update_port() code was not changed
    to pass in the nsx security_group uuids. This patch fixes that so that the
    nsx uuids are passed in instead of neutron.

    Avoid unnecessarily checking the existence of a device
    
    Plugging a device usually involves checking for the existence of the
    device twice, once before calling plug and once after.  It turns out
    that these calls are expensive, often taking a half second or more
    each.  For that reason, it is worth the effort to make sure we check
    only once.
    
    The device driver is now responsible for cleanly plugging/unplugging
    the device without knowing whether it exists or not.  Pushing this
    responsibility to the device driver allows implementing it more
    efficiently in terms of calls made out to the operating system.
    
    This is targetted at the neutron-tempest-parallel bp because it shaves
    time off the time to set up a router, something that hinders parallel
    performance.

    Otherwise, it runs the command without it in the default namespace.

    Previously, if you started neutron-server with an empty database some

    Embrane Plugin fails alembic migrations
    
    Alembic migration from revision f44ab9871cd6 to 2eeaf963a447 is failing on
    Embrane Plugin because the floatingips table doesn't exist.
    
    The problem happens because the plugin is actually inheriting from OVS's Plugin,
    and therefore it doesn't take part of the correct migration path at installation time.
    
    As far as I have investigated, adding the support on ext_gw_mode and l3_support is enough to solve the problem.

    Delete subnet fails if assoc port has IPs from another subnet
    
    This change fixes the following failure scenario:
    - Create a network
    - Create two subnets on the network
    - Create a port on the network using one of the subnets
    - Delete the other subnet
    = = = > FAILURE: Subnet delete fails because supposedly there
    is/are port(s) still associated with that subnet.
    
    The problem addressed is that delete_subnet() in
    neutron/db/db_base_plugin.py is checking for port(s) still being
    associated with the subnet's network, not the subnet itself.

    Improves Arista's ML2 driver's sync performance
    
    In large scale deployments a full sync between Neutron and EOS can take minutes.
    In order to cut that time, this patch batches multimle EOS CLI commands and
    sends them to EOS instead of sending each command separately. For example, if a
    tenant has 10 networks, instead of making 10 RPC calls to EOS to create those 10
    networks, this patch builds a commands to create those 10 networks and makes
    just one RPC call to EOS which cuts down sync times significantly. All the _bulk()
    methods are added to batch such requests.
    
    Another optimization is to timestamp when the Region data was modified (This
    includes any tenant creation, their networks, VMs and ports). The sync gets the
    timestamp from EOS and only if the timestamps do not match, the driver performs
    a full sync.

    nec plugin: Avoid long transaction in delete_ports
    
    db_plugin.delete_ports() can lead to long transaction
    if plugin.deleete_port talks with external system.
    This commit removes a transaction in delete_ports and
    allows NEC plugin to use more granular db transactions
    in delete_port. It greatly helps db race conditions and
    timeouts in delete_port operations.
    
    To avoid to impact other plugins/drivers by changing
    db_plugin.delete_ports directly and to land this patch soon,
    this commit overrides delete_ports() in NEC plugin.
    Further disssion on transaction in delete_ports will be
    discussed under bug 1282925.

    Found when I enabled test_extension_allowedaddress_pairs, where
    test_create_port_removed_allowed_address_pairs would fail due to the
    returned port still containing the original addresspair.  The cause is
    ovs simply not updating the port info being returned.
    
    This patch additionally enables test_extension_allowedaddress_pairs for
    openvswitch.
    
    Moved checks and updating into method similar to what we do for
    extradhcpopts and security_groups.
    
    Additionally, this required fixing is_address_pairs_attribute_updated() as
    it was passing (non-hashable) dicts to utils.compare_elements.

    Change firewall to DOWN when admin state down
    
    Currently firewall remains in status "ACTIVE" after admin state
    is changed to DOWN.
    
    This fix sets firewall status to "DOWN" if admin state is updated
    from "UP" to "DOWN". "DOWN" status is used by other network resources
    so use "DOWN" to keep consistent.

    ovs-agent: use hexadecimal IP address in tunnel port name
    
    The remote IP address is used to form the tunnel port name when
    the ovs-agent is used with the ML2 plugin. With some OVS/Linux
    combinations there is a 15 character limit on port names, so a
    name like 'gre-192.168.10.10' does not work. This fix uses the
    shorter hexadecimal representation of the IP address instead.

    Fix DetachedInstanceError for Agent instance
    
    The stacktrace observed seems to hint to a
    situation where a session is not properly
    rolled back when duplicate agent entries are
    found.
    
    Since it is ok to deal with duplicates, the
    addition of agents to the DB must be done
    one by one, otherwise we go against the
    ATOMICITY property of a transaction of all
    or none. It's either that or I am barking at
    the wrong tree.
    
    This patch also added UT to cover affected
    code.

    Fix NSX migration path
    
    The migration path for the NSX plugin was not working correctly,
    as two migrations (extra route and network gateways) were
    skipped.
    Therefore installations were partially relying on automatic
    schema generation.
    
    This patch fixes the migration path, as well as an attribute
    whose name in the migration and the DB model differed.

    ML2 mechanism driver access to binding details
    
    The following properties are added to the PortContext object passed to
    ML2 mechanism drivers for port operations:
    
    * bound_driver - name of current bound driver
    * original_bound_driver - name previously bound driver in an update
    * original_bound_segment - network segment used in previous binding
    
    Some issues with the existing ML2 port binding unit tests were also
    fixed.
    
    The remainder of the fix for bug 1276395, making these binding details
    available to mechanism drivers when a port is deleted, will be
    addressed as part of the fix for bug 1276391.

    Include proper Content-Type in the HTTP response headers
    
    Neutron namespace proxy handler and metadata agent were not setting the
    Content-Type in its response. Both of them were returning only the response
    data which is obtained from the nova-metadata-service. Since they were returning
    only the response data, the Content-Type returned to the clients has the default
    one which is - "text/html". Ideally this should be set to the data type which is
    present in the HTTP Response. The fix now includes the Content-Type which is
    returned by nova-metadata-service

    Need to prohibit health monitor deletion if it has associations with

    of monitor deletion becomes complex and unreliable since association
    deletion may fail on any single driver.

    NSX: Fix status sync with correct mappings
    
    The code that syncs router status to the neutron_db was using the nsx
    router id instead of the neutron router id thus synchronize_router
    would never update the database.
    
    Also, the switch synchronization routine was not fetching the
    appropriate neutron id tag thus causing switch synchronization to
    be skipped.
    
    This patch also fixes the error in the unit tests which allowed for
    the bug to be introduced.

    Replace binding:capabilities with binding:vif_details
    
    In addition to binding:vif_type, the neutron core plugin needs to
    supply various information to nova's VIF driver, such as VIF security
    details and PCI details when SR-IOV is being used. This information is
    read-only, requires admin privileges, and is not intended for normal
    users. Rather than add separate mechanisms throughout the stack for
    each such requirement, the binding:capabilities port attibute, which
    is a dictionary and is not currently not used by nova, is renamed to
    binding:vif_details to serve as a general-purpose mechanism for
    supplying binding-specific details to the VIF driver.
    
    This patch does not remove or replace the CAP_PORT_FILTER boolean
    previously used in binding:capabilities. A separate patch should
    implement the specific key/value pairs carried by binding:vif_details
    to implement VIF security. Another patch will implement the key/value
    pairs needed for SR-IOV.
    
    The ML2 plugin now allows the bound mechanism driver to supply the
    binding:vif_details dictionary content, instead of just the
    CAP_PORT_FILTER boolean previously carried by the binding:capabilities
    attribute.
    
    DocImpact: Need to update portbinding extension API, but no impact on
    user or administrator documentation.

    BigSwitch: Fix tenant_id for shared net requests
    
    The URI port requests are sent to on the backend
    contains the tenant_id of the network. This corrects
    a bug where, on port updates and deletes, the tenant_id
    of the port rather than the network was being used,
    which was incorrect when attached to a shared network.

    The call to get_port_status in update_port was passing in the neutron

    but now are different. This patch updates the code so that it now
    passes in the correct uuid.

    Plugins should call __init__ of db_base_plugin for db.configure
    
    Currently each plugin calls db.configure() within the plugin's __init__
    class or defines an initialize() method that's sole job is to call this
    method. Instead we should just call the super method of a plugin so that
    db.configure() is called for us out of the db_base_plugin class.
    
    Note: the only reason why I'm making this change is that I want to add
    something to the __init__() class of the db_base_plugin that's needed for
    the nova-event-callback blueprint and adding it in the base class of init
    looks to be the best place.

    Handle racing condition in OFC port deletion
    
    Multiple delete_port operations can run in parallel.
    For such case later operation(s) will receive 404 (NotFound)
    error from OFC or NotResultFound sqlalchemy exception.
    These are valid exceptions and they should be ignored
    in delete_port operations.
    
    Closes-Bug: #1281574
    
    OFCConsistencyBroken is renamed to OFCMappingNotFound
    because when multiple delete_port operations run in parallel
    OFCConsistencyBroken can occur and it is a valid case

    Don't require passing in port_security=False if security_groups present
    
    If creating a port on a network that is marked as port_security_enabled=False
    and one passes in a security_group in the port_create request previously an
    error was raised saying they needed to also pass in
    port_security_enabled=False. This patch removes that requirement and instead
    sets port_security_enabled=True internally if a port has an ip_address and a
    security_group is passed in. This is more convient and does not break
    backwards compatibility.

    Use different context for each API request in unit tests
    
    test_router_add_interface_subnet_with_port_from_other_tenant in
    neutron.tests.unit.test_l3_plugin.L3NatTestCaseBase was mocking
    neutron.context.Context thus performing multiple API requests
    with the same context instance. As a context instance also has
    a DB session attribute, this might cause unexpected side effects,
    especially for plugins which process request asynchronously.
    
    The plugin neutron.plugins.nicira.NeutronServicePlugin was being
    affected.
    
    This patch ensures each request has a different context object
    without changing the unit test semantics.
    
    It also refactors slightly test_edge_router.py in the nicira
    unit test package to avoid executing twice the same unit tests.

    Fix unshortened IPv6 address caused DHCP crash
    
    When unshortened IPv6 address provided to allocation pool, DHCP
    agent crashed because OpenStack is trying to add same IPv6 addresses
    to dhcp tap device.
    
    The root cause is that current code compares provided unshortened
    IPv6 address with the returned result of "ip addr list", which is
    shortened. So the same IPv6 address is treated as different ones.
    
    The fix is trying to shorten the provided address before comparison.

    Add support to request vnic type on port
    
    This patch adds support for requested vnic_type to be plugged to neutron port to ML2 plugin.
    This patch contains:
    1. New attribute 'binding:vnic_type' added to port binding extension.
       Possible values are 'direct', 'macvtap' and 'normal'.
       'binding:vnic_type' is allowed to be defined on port creation or changed
       on port update by admin or tenant user.
       'binding:vnic_type' can be also skipped in port defintion
    2. Management of vnic_type by ML2 plugin, assuming default
    vnic_type=normal
    3. Add 'vnic_type' to ml2_port_bindings DB table
    4. Add supported vnic_types for MechanismDrivers that are capable to bind
    port.
    5. Add DB migration script for ml2_vnic_type.
    
    DocImpact: Need to update portbindings API docs and include in SR-IOV user docs

    Improve unit test coverage for Cisco plugin model code
    
    Closes-Bug: #1190620
    
    This fix improves unit test coverage for:
    quantum/plugins/cisco/models/virt_phy_sw_v2.py
    Test coverage is improved from about 78% to 99%.
    
    One change included in this fix is removal of some code in
    the _invoke_plugin() method in virt_phy_sw_v2.py which looks
    like it's attempting to handle the case where the number of
    arguments being passed to _invoke_plugin() exceeds the number
    of arguments expected for the target plugin method. This
    section of code does not get executed for any existing
    calls to _invoke_plugin(), and it doesn't appear that
    this logic would work (except when the target plugin method
    includes a **kwargs expansion).

    Embrane Tempest Compliance
    
    This changeset tracks the changes needed by the Embrane's Neutron Plugin
    in order to consistently  pass tempest tests.
    
    Changes:
    
    - Some db transactions were too long and were causing lock timeout
    exception. Removed useless transactions (waiting on non-db tasks to complete)
    to fix the problem.
    
    - The operation filter was useless, and breaking the tests. Most of the
    logic which guarantees the appliance correct state when an operation in executed
    is now in the internal library used for the heleos APIs.
    The filter was therefore removed (as well as the corresponding exception).
    
    - Fixed "sync" mode. The behavior was incorrect due to the queue timeout.
    Furthermore, parallel requests were not waiting on the correct thread.
    
    - Added missing methods for floating IPs (not all the scenarios were covered).
    
    - Minor bug fixes caught during the tests.

    Fix invalid facilities documented in rootwrap.conf
    
    The values user0 and user1 do not map to valid facility values.
    local1, etc.  Using user0 results in a  pri value that does not map
    back to a facility of the same name in syslog.
    
    RFC5424 suggest values values of local0 through local7.  Setting
    syslog_log_facility to one of those values results in a message with a
    priority that can be mapped back to the original string value.
    
    This fix adjusts the comment in rootwrap.conf to suggest the local
    prefix instead of the user prefix.

    Reset the policy after loading extensions
    
    The loading of extensions might impact how rules are interpreted in the
    policies; for instance, the external-net extension specifies how to
    convert the router:external field of a network (to a boolean). So we
    need to make sure that the policy is recreated afterwards.
    
    We also need to fix a unit test that assumes that the policy is loaded.

    Parse JSON in ovs_lib.get_vif_port_by_id
    
    This patch replaces regex matching of text output with parsing
    of JSON output in ovs_lib.get_vif_port_by_id.
    This makes the code more reliable as subtle, possibly even
    cosmetic, changes in ovs-vsctl output format could cause the
    regular expression match to fail.
    
    Also, this makes the code consistent with ovs_lib.get_vif_port_set
    which already uses JSON output.
    
    Finally this patch slightly changes the behaviour of
    ovs_lib.get_vif_port_by_id returning None if elements such as
    mac address or ofport were not available.

    Fix request timeout errors during calls to NSX controller
    
    Sometimes two correlated exception traces are observed in
    the server log for the Neutron Server backed by NSX:
    RequestTimeout (The nsx request has timed out) and
    OperationalError (Lock wait timeout exceeded). This is
    generally described by Guru Salvatore Orlando as the,
    and I quote, the "infamous eventlet-mysql deadlock".
    
    This patch tries to address the issue by adding a
    cooperative yield in the nsx client code (it’s a good idea
    to call sleep(0) occasionally in any case) and also by
    avoiding the unnecessary spawning of another Greenthread
    within a call that is already executed in Greenthred
    itself.

    L3 agent fetches the external network id once
    
    Rather than fetching the id of the external network each time that
    _process_routers is called, get it once and remember it.  If the agent
    is ever requested to connect to a different ext-net then it will fetch
    the current ext-net to double check for the unlikely event that the
    ext-net has changed.  If it has then it will remember the new ext-net.
    
    This is only applicable in the case where there is only one ext-net
    that has not been configured explicitly in the config file.  That was
    the only case that would cause an RPC message in the first place.

    Avoid processing ports which are not yet ready
    
    This patch changes get_vif_port_set in order to not return
    OVS ports for which the ofport is not yet assigned, thus avoiding
    a regex match failure in get_vif_port_by_id.
    Because of this failure, treat_vif_port is unable to wire
    the port.
    As get_vif_port_by_id is also used elsewhere in the agent, it has
    been enhanced in order to tolerate situations in which ofport might
    have not yet been assigned.
    
    The ofport field is added to the list of those monitored by the
    SimpleInterfaceMonitor. This will guarantee an event is generated
    when the ofport is assigned to a port. Otherwise there is a risk
    a port would be never processed if it was not yet ready the first
    time is was detected. This change won't trigger any extra processing
    on the agent side.
    
    Finally, this patch avoids fetching device details from the plugin
    for ports which have disappeared from the OVS bridge. This is a
    little optimization which might be beneficial for short lived ports.

    Raise an error from ovs_lib list operations
    
    Previously list operations in ovs_lib returns an empty list
    if RuntimeError occurs and a caller cannot distinguish an error
    from normal results. This commit changes ovs_lib list operations
    (get_vif_port_set, get_vif_ports, get_bridges) to raise an
    exception when RuntimeError occurs.
    
    Note: callers of these commands are ovs/nec/ryu-agent and ovs_cleanup.
    - plugin agents: these commands are inside in try/except clause
      in daemon loop and there is no need to change.
    - ovs_cleanup: there is no error catch logic in main() at now
      and it calls commands other than ovs_lib, so it can be cleanup
      later if required.

    Move db migration of ml2 security groups to havana
    
    ml2 plugin is a havana feature. Currently securitygroups table are
    created in chain of migration after havana release. It causes db
    migration failure when migrating from havana to current head because
    securitygroups table is attempted to be created although it was already
    created by create_all().

    Add migration support from agent to NSX dhcp/metadata services
    
    This is feature patch (3 of 3) that introduces support for
    transitioning existing NSX-based deployments from the agent
    based model of providing dhcp and metadata proxy services
    to the new agentless based mode. In 'combined' mode, existing
    networks will still be served by the existing infrastructure,
    whereas new networks will be served by the new infrastructure.
    
    Networks may be migrated to the model using a new CLI tool
    provided, called 'neutron-nsx-manage'. Currently the tool
    provides two admin-only commands:
    
      neutron-nsx-manage net-report <net-id-or-name>
    
    This will check that the network can be migrated and returns
    the resources currently in use. And:
    
      neutron-nsx-manage net-migrate <net-id-or-name>
    
    This will move the network over the new model and deallocate
    resources from the agent. Once a network has been migrated
    there is no turning back.

    NSX plugin: fix floatingip re-association
    
    The NSX plugin does not allow to reassociate a floating IP to
    a different internal IP address on the same port where it's
    currently associated.
    This patch fixes this behaviour and adds a unit test to ensure
    re-association on the same port with a different IP is possible.
    
    A few tweaks to the unit test aux functions were necessary to
    accomodate the newly introduced unit test.

    Fix binding:host_id is set to None when port update
    
    when updating a port 'binding:host_id' is reset if not specified among
    the parameter to be updated. As a result, a None value for
    'binding:host_id' is sent from the notifier which might potentially
    cause consumers to not work properly.

    Improve handling of security group updates
    
    Currently updates to security group rules or membership
    are handled by immediately triggering a call to refresh_firewall.
    This call is quite expensive, and it is often executed with a
    very high frequency.
    
    With this patch, the notification handler simply adds devices for
    which the firewall should be refreshed to a set, which will then
    be processed in another routine. The latter is supposed to
    be called in the main agent loop.
    
    This patch for 'provider updates' simply sets a flag for refreshing
    the firewall for all devices.
    
    In order to avoid breaking other agents leveraging the security
    group RPC mixin, the reactive behaviour is still available, and is
    still the default way of handling security group updates.

    Fix passing keystone token to neutronclient instance
    
    Neutron client expects token to be passed as token= argument, while
    neutron-metadata-agent passes auth_token= instead. This effectively makes the
    client to authenticate against keystone each time it's instantiated. In
    neutron-metadata-agent case, it means 'each time a client sends a metadata
    request.'
    
    The issue results in high cpu utilization on keystone side when simultaneously

    Configure floating IPs addresses after NAT rules
    
    Change the behaviour of the L3 agent in order to set the IP addresses
    for the floating IPs on the external gateway interface after the
    relevant NAT rules have been applied.
    This will avoid a transitory period in which the floating IP exists
    and is reachable but it not yet wired to the actual target.

    Avoid re-wiring ports unnecessarily
    
    In the majority of cases a port_update notification pertains
    a change in the properties affecting port filter, and does
    not affect port wiring, ie: the local vlan tag.
    
    This patch simply avoids doing port wiring/unwiring if the
    local vlan tag did not change.
    The extra overhead for the ovs-db get operation is offset
    by the fact that get commands are generally faster than
    set commands, and by avoiding executing the ovs-ofctl operation.

    Process port_update notifications in the main agent loop
    
    Instead of processing a port update notification directly in
    the RPC call, the actual processing is moved into the main
    rpc loop, whereas the RPC call just adds the updated port
    identifier to a set of updated ports.
    In this way, a port_update notification won't compete with the
    main rpc loop, causing long delays into its completion under
    heavy load. Also, repeated port_update notifications received
    within a single iteration of the main agent loop will be
    coalesced and processed only once.
    This will also avoid the risk of processing notifications out
    of order thus ending up with an actual configuration which
    differs from the desired one.
    
    This patch still performs L2 wiring for updated ports even if
    it is necessary only when the administrative state of a port
    changes.
    
    The update_ports method has been renamed to scan_ports as the latter
    name appears to be more in line with what the method actually does.

    Simplify ip allocation/recycling to relieve db pressure
    
    I found that multiple calls to delete_port can pile up on the
    _recycle_ip operation.  This patch simplifies this operation.  It
    reduces the _recycle_ip operation to a single row delete in the ip
    allocations table and doesn't touch the availability table.
    
    To acheive the recycling of ips in a pool, this code runs a more
    complex operation of rebuilding the availability table when it is
    exhausted.  Only one API process will perform this more expensive
    operation and others waiting for allocation will immediately benefit.
    The amortized cost of this operation is much less than the cumulative
    cost of running the more expensive _recycle_ip operation for every
    port delete.
    
    IP allocation behaves a bit differently with this patch.  Instead of
    giving out the first IP available in a pool, the entire pool will be
    allocated before wrapping around and recycling ip addresses that have
    been released.  This is a desirable feature as it puts ip addresses in
    a sort of quarantine after they are released.  It is easier to
    distinguish newly allocated ips from old ones.

    L3 Agent restart causes network outage
    
    When a L3 agent controlling multiple qrouter namespaces
    restarts, it destroys all qrouter namespaces even if
    some of them are still in use.  As a result, network
    traffic could be stopped on the VMs that use the
    networks associated with these namespaces.
    
    So what is needed is for the L3 agent to preserve those
    qrouter namespaces a L3 agent instance recognizes and to
    destroy those it does not know about.

    Minimize the cost of checking for api worker exit
    
    A recent change to oslo allows the configuration of the interval
    that ProcessLauncher waits between checks of child exit.  The
    default interval of 0.01s resulted in the neutron service consuming
    unnecessary cpu cycles checking whether api workers had exited (5%
    cpu on idle in a VM).  This patch extends the interval to 1s to
    minimize the cost of the checks.

    Remove and recreate interface if already exists
    
    If the dhcp-agent machine restarts when openvswitch comes up it logs the
    following warning messages for all tap interfaces that do not exist:
    
    bridge|WARN|could not open network device tap2cf7dbad-9d (No such device)
    
    Once the dhcp-agent starts it recreates the interfaces and re-adds them to the
    ovs-bridge. Unfortunately, ovs does not reinitialize the interfaces as they
    are already in ovsdb and does not assign them a ofport number.
    
    This situation corrects itself though the next time a port is added to the
    ovs-bridge which is why no one has probably noticed this issue till now.
    
    In order to correct this we should first remove interface that exist and
    then readd them.

    Use an independent iptables lock per namespace
    
    Since iptables is independent from namespace to namespace, it makes
    sense to use an independent lock per namespace.  This improvement is
    aimed at improving the parallel performance in the L3 agent.

    Fix race condition on ml2 delete and update port methods
    
    Synchronize access to ports table when deleting and updating
    a port. Otherwise concurrent update/delete request for the same port
    may cause neutron server to throw an exception and return
    '500 Internal server error' for such requests.

    Fix Migration 50e86cb2637a and 38335592a0dc
    
    When the rename of quantum->neutron occurred here ee3fe4e8 it also renamed
    the the table creation from quantum_nvp_port_mapping to
    neutron_nvp_port_mapping. This went undetected for a long time because
    when neutron-server starts up it pushes down the scheme for tables that
    are not there so the table would be created.
    
    Because of this the following migration 50e86cb2637a called
    op.rename_table('neutron_nvp_port_mapping', 'neutron_nsx_port_mappings')
    though the table name being used was quantum_nvp_port_mapping. Because of this
    the quantum_id->nvp_id mapping was never migrated over to the new table and
    you would be left with a quantum_nvp_port_mapping table hanging around.
    
    In addition, the downgrade would rename the table to neutron_nvp_port_mapping
    instead of quantum_nvp_port_mapping. This patch addresses this issues.

    LBaaS: handle NotFound exceptions in update_status callback
    
    LBaaS agent may send update_status requests to server on objects
    which were already deleted from db: this is due to creating and
    deleting objects with a high rate (like tempest API tests do).
    As a result errors and stacktraces appear in server and agent logs.
    The proposed solution is to catch NotFound exceptions and print a warning.

    Remove plugin_name_v2 and extension_manager in test_config
    
    There are two ways to specify a core plugin and an extension manager
    in the unit tests: test_config and arguments of the constructor.
    Both are used and it sometimes makes it a bit difficult to debug.
    This patch removes the way via test_config and makes constructor
    arguments the only way to do it.
    
    Also removes the default entries in test_config because they are
    not used anywhere.

    nicira: fix db integrity error during port deletion
    
    Due to the fact that plugin port operations are not
    transactional (as they involve non synchronized DB
    and Controller operations), concurrent (interleaved)
    port requests may accidentally cause the insertion
    of the mapping entry (neutron-port-id, nvp-port-id)
    more than once. In case this occurs, it's safe to
    expect the failure and continue the normal process
    of the operation being requested.

    Start of new developer documentation
    
    There is currently no useful developer-focused documentation in-tree
    for Neutron. There are a smattering of useful documents on the
    OpenStack wiki, however, there isn't a good organization to this
    information, nor is there a condensed developer focus to a lot of it.
    Some of the wiki pages are more proposals for features or bug fixes,
    and there is a need for architecture, design, and code walk-through
    documentation for Neutron to help with new (and existing) contribution.
    
    This patch begins the process of adding developer documentation to Neutron.
    It updates the main developer reference index.rst to pull in-line with what
    Nova is doing, leaving some todo references for future patches. It also
    adds a development.environment tutorial that is up-to-date with current
    Neutron development, using tox/testr processes for running unit tests and
    including a number of references to external wiki pages that have
    instructions for using DevStack for OpenStack contribution/testing.
    
    The next series of patches will add automodule documentation to the
    developer reference for some of the major modules in Neutron.

    Corrects broken format strings in check_i18n.py
    
    In tools/check_i18n.py, the error messages printed out
    had format strings that included 5 interpolations, but only
    four variables were supplied. This patch simply corrects that
    mismatch by including the name of the predicate or checker
    that failed.

    [ML2] l2-pop MD handle multi create/delete ports
    
    If more than one port is added or removed simultaneously, port db entry
    have status BUILD or DOWN and pass to ACTIVE when agent have finish to
    configured it.
    l2-pop mechanism driver use events port pass to ACTIVE or DOWN to send
    fdb entries. In case of port is the first or the last network port on
    an agent, the flooding entry need to be add or removed.
    
    This patch fix the method to determine how many ports are active on a
    agent by adding filter on status port to be ACTIVE.

    Send DHCP notifications regardless of agent status
    
    The Neutron service, when under load, may not be able to process
    agent heartbeats in a timely fashion.  This can result in
    agents being erroneously considered inactive.  Previously, DHCP
    notifications for which active agents could not be found were
    silently dropped.  This change ensures that notifications for
    a given network are sent to agents even if those agents do not
    appear to be active.
    
    Additionally, if no enabled dhcp agents can be found for a given
    network, an error will be logged.  Raising an exception might be
    preferable, but has such a large testing impact that it will be
    submitted as a separate patch if deemed necessary.

    This patch adds the logical switch identifier in the model class
    for describing mappings between neutron and nsx switch ports.
    This will allow for a better handling of the chained logical switch
    use case.
    
    This patch also moves the routines for retrieving nsx identifiers
    in a separate module in preparation for the introduction of async
    operations and renames relevant model classes, attributes, and
    functions from 'nvp' to 'nsx'.

    extra_dhcp_opt add checks for empty strings
    
    When passing extra-dhcp-opt into the port-create where an empty string
    is provided as opt_value='   ', the create and update routine will load the
    empty string into the DB. The result when written to the opts file is:
    "tag:ece4c8aa-15c9-4f6b-8c42-7d4e285734bf,option:server-ip-address", which
    when read by dnsmasq has been tested to cause dnsmasq to segment fault.

    LBaaS: synchronize haproxy deploy/undeploy_instance methods
    
    When creating/deleting lbaas objects at a high rate (like tempest api tests do)
    deploy/undeploy_unstance methods of haproxy namespace driver
    may be executed concurrently which leads to different conflicts with
    network namespaces and interfaces created by the diver.
    
    @synchronized decorator should be used in order to ensure that only one thread
    will execute one of the methods at a time.

    NVP plugin: Do backend router delete out from db transaction
    
    Performing the NVP API operation from within a DB transaction
    increases the risk of a deadlock between sqlalchemy and eventlet.
    
    With this patch, the operation is moved outside of the db transaction
    and appropriate mechanism are put in place for:
    i) ensuring neutron db consistency in case of NVP failures
    ii) avoiding deleting from backend if neutron logic does not allow it
    
    This patch also synchronizes the routine for removing a router
    gateway port from NVP.

    NVP plugin: Avoid timeouts if creating routers in parallel
    
    There is a well-known issue of eventlet causing deadlocks with
    mysql transactions; such condition might occur when
    creating NVP routers in parallel.
    
    To avoid this, this patch moves the long-running method
    _update_router_gw_info outside of the mysql transaction, adding
    the appropriate failure management code, and adds a lock to the
    method _nvp_create_ext_gw_port, to ensure serial access to it.
    
    Unit tests for verifying correct behaviour in case of failures
    are added as well.

    Updates tox.ini to use new features
    
    tox 1.6 allows us to skip the sdist step, which is slow. This does that.
    It also allows us to override the install line. In this case, it's
    important as it allows us to stop getting pre-release software we
    weren't asking for.

    Add X-Tenant-ID to metadata request
    
    Previously, one could update a port's device_id to be that of
    another tenant's instance_id and then be able to retrieve that
    instance's metadata. In order to prevent this X-Tenant-ID is now
    passed in the metadata request to nova and nova then checks that
    X-Tenant-ID also matches the tenant_id for the instance against it's
    database to ensure it's not being spoofed.
    
    DocImpact - When upgrading OpenStack nova and neturon, neutron
                should be updated first (and neutron-metadata-agent
                restarted before nova is upgraded) in order to minimize
                downtime. This is because there is also a patch to nova
                which has checks X-Tenant-ID against it's database
                therefore neutron-metadata-agent needs to pass that
                before nova is upgraded for metadata to work.

    Update common network type consts to same origin
    
    This patch removes new definitions of common network type constants (TYPE_FLAT,
    TYPE_LOCAL, etc.) and modifies uses of aforementioned constants to a common
    place where constants are defined (neutron.plugins.common.constants). This
    patch does not change values that are equal in value but different in name:
    NETWORK_TYPE_FLAT vs TYPE_FLAT. A second changeset will be made to handle that
    case.
    
    Unit tests were modified as well when they referred to the constant.
    
    Finally, the ovs agent code refers to the OVS plugin constants directly and
    these had to be changed as well. A TODO flag was put in that file due to use
    of another plugin specific constant.
    
    Network types that were only defined in a single plugin, such as mellanox's
    infiniband (IB) network type was not carried over to the common constants file.

    LBaaS: unify haproxy-on-host plugin driver and agent
    
    Unifies haproxy reference implementation to make common agent based plugin driver
    which is suitable for all vendors who wants to use async mechanism.
    
     - Agent API as well as device driver API changed to handle
       loadbalancer objects individually;
     - Agent loads device drivers according to config;
     - LogicalDeviceCache class was removed from agent as it was used only
       as a list - to put and remove entries ant check whether entry is in or not.
       It was replaced with instance_mapping dict in agent to store known instances and
       corresponding device_drivers;
     - Agent reports which device drivers are supported (needs for scheduling on plugin side);
     - Agent-to-plugin API was extended to provide an ability for agent to update
       statuses of pools/vips/members/health_monitors;
     - Vendor should only implement device driver; plugin driver just needs
       to inherit AgentBasedPluginDriver and override device_driver member;
     - This patch doesn't move files to make review easier;
       all rename/replace will be done in a subsequent patch;
    
    DocImpact
    
    NOTE: Since the change in the agent RPC API is backward-incompatible
    (major RPC version change), LBaaS server-agent communications will be
    completely broken until both sides are upgraded so users will be unable to
    create new or update existing HAProxy loadbalancer instances during upgrade

    Add post-mortem debug option for tests
    
    Post-mortem debugging, the ability to drop into a debugger with the
    execution state that triggered the exception, is very useful in
    diagnosing failure conditions.  Our previous test runner, nose,
    provided the ability to enable post-mortem debugging on test
    failures (via --pdb-failure) and errors (via --pdb).  testr
    lacks these options at present, so this change adds support
    for enabling post-mortem debugging via an environment variable.
    All test-triggered exceptions will result in a post-mortem debugger
    being invoked if OS_POST_MORTEM_DEBUG is set to "1" or "True".

    Fix a race condition in agents status update code
    
    Code handling agents status updates coming via RPC checks,
    if a corresponding entry for the given (agent_type, host)
    pair already exists in DB and updates it. And if it doesn't
    exist, a new entry is created.
    
    Without a unique constraint this can cause a race condition
    resulting in adding of two agent entries having the same value
    of (agent_type, host) pair.
    
    Note, that it's already not allowed to have multiple agents of
    the same type having the same host value, but currently it's
    enforced only at code level, not at DB schema level, which
    effectively makes race conditions possible.

    Remove dead code _arp_spoofing_rule()
    
    This code should have been removed when the allowed_address_pair
    extension was added here (0efce6195fa7be80e110bd841dc9b3537a94c376).
    The arp spoofing rules are handled in the method _setup_spoof_filter_chain().
    
    Reported by: Amir Sadoughi that this was crud I left behind :)

    Handle exceptions on create_dhcp_port
    
    If a network/subnet is deleted while creating the dhcp
    port, the agent will detect a conflict on state of the
    network and deal with it accordingly.
    
    A concurrent delete may manifest itself via a number
    of exceptions, IPAddressGenerationFailure amongst others,
    hence the refactoring of the error handling logic into its
    own utility method.

    Fix unable to add allow all IPv4/6 security group rule
    
    Previously, if one tried to add a rule to allow all ingress ipv4 neutron
    would respond that the rule was already part of the security group.
    This happened as the filter for querying existing rules uses a wildcard for
    remote_group_id thus returning a false match. This patch addresses
    this issue.

    This reverts commit 0d131ff0e9964cb6a65f64809270f9d597c2d5d1
    
    There is really no problem with this change. However, it is probably
    triggering a port_update notification to the agent for each port
    with an allocated IP.
    The agent handles that notification in a way which might be improved
    from a scalability perspective.
    
    I don't actually want this change to removed, I am just checking
    whether neutron without it passess jobs.

    l3_agent: make process_router more robust
    
    If internal_network_added/removed fails, _sync_routers_task will call
    process_router to do fault recovery. Because the port is already
    added/removed to/from ri.internal_ports, internal_network_added or
    internal_network_removed will not be called again.
    
    The patch fix this issue by calling ri.internal_ports.append/removed
    only if internal_network_added/removed succeed. Without the patch,
    the added testcases would fail.

    Stop logging unnecessary warning on context create
    
    The context was previously logging at the 'warn' level when unknown
    kwargs were being passed to its __init__().  Since the agents were
    passing tenant=None with each rpc request, this was generating an
    unreasonable amount of log chatter that would not be useful to an
    operator.  The fix is to log at the debug level instead so that
    the operators don't see the output by default but developers can
    still choose to.

    Avoid loading policy when processing rpc requests
    
    When Neutron server is restarted in the environment where multiple agents
    are sending rpc requests to Neutron, it causes loading of policy.json
    before API extensions are loaded. That causes different policy check
    failures later on.
    This patch avoids loading policy when creating a Context in rpc layer.

    Improve unit test coverage for Cisco plugin base code
    
    Closes-Bug: #1190621
    
    This fix improves test code coverage for the file:
    neutron/plugins/cisco/network_plugin.py
    from 34% to 98%.
    
    Some of the changes made to realize this code coverage improvements
    are the following:
    - Core API methods (create_network, update_network, etc.) have been
      removed from the core plugin (network_plugin.py). These methods
      are currently unused. Before this change, we relied on the underlying
      model layer to inform the core plugin whether or not the model layer
      was capable of handling these core API calls itself via a 'MANAGE_STATE'
      attribute. However, there is only one existing model layer
      implementation (i.e. for Nexus plugin; the N1KV plugin does not use
      network_plugin.py), and that model layer supports the core API calls.
      Given that it is unlikely that another model layer for the Cisco Nexus
      plugin will ever be developed (esp. with the availability of the ML2
      plugin), so it makes more sense to delete this untested code.
    - Exception raising for non-existent credentials has been removed from
      get_credential_details and rename_credential methods since
      exceptions are already raised for this condition in lower-level
      credential database code.
    - The schedule_host, associate_port, and detach_port methods are
      deleted because these essentially do nothing useful (log a debug
      message and then return None), since these methods look for
      the same-named methods in the model layer, but these methods are
      not defined in the model layer.
    - The helper functions _invoke_device_plugins and _func_name are
      deleted because they are no longer used.
    - In unit test code for the Cisco QoS and credentials database, calls
      are now made indirectly through the core plugin (network_plugin.py)
      extension API methods, as a quick-and-easy way to provide code
      coverage for these core plugin methods.

    Rebind security groups only when they're updated
    
    Update the security port bindings for a port only when they actually
    differ from the stored value.
    
    This will also avoid sending port_update notifications to the agent
    even if nothing actually changes in the port configuration.

    Fix format errors seen in rpc logging
    
    The previous commit for this bug didn't include the 'project_name'
    key in the context dict.  The missing key was causing the amqp
    module to generate log formatting exceptions instead of normal
    log output.
    
    Separately, the context module itself was generating logging
    exceptions in the quantum service when logging was attempted
    before the context was fully initialized

    Improve unit test coverage for Cisco plugin nexus code
    
    Closes-Bug: #1190622
    
    This fix improves the unit test coverage for the Cisco Nexus plugin's
    cisco_nexus_network_driver_v2.py and cisco_nexus_plugin_v2.py
    source files from:
    cisco_nexus_network_driver_v2: 72%
    cisco_nexus_plugin_v2:         79%
    To:
    cisco_nexus_network_driver_v2: 99%
    cisco_nexus_plugin_v2:         94%
    
    Much of what the remaining "uncovered" code (coverage tool
    reports as partially covered) can be attributed to the
    coverage tool not being aware that execution does not
    continue at the end of a save_and_reraise_exception()
    context block (i.e. the exception will be reraised, but
    the coverage tool isn't aware of this).
    
    This fix and coverage results are dependent on the fix for #1246080.

    Avoid dhcp agent race condition on subnet and network delete
    
    Ensure that ports that are about to be deleted are 'selected
    for update'. By doing so, we avoid a race condition between
    subnet and network delete operations carried out by two
    separate server instances.
    
    A race caused by the dhcp agent deleting the DHCP port
    (caused by a subnet-delete event notification) can
    still occur and will be addressed in a subsequent patch.
    
    delete_subnet's way to delete ports has been tweaked to
    ensure that postgres db can handle the SELECT FOR UPDATE
    correctly.

    ML2 plugin should not delete ports on subnet deletion
    
    On subnet deletion ports are deleted asynchronously by dhcp agent
    so plugin doesn't need to delete them itself.
    Instead Ml2Plugin.delete_subnet() method should call update_port()
    for each allocation to remove the IP from the port and call the MechanismDrivers.
    The patch also adds subnets test suite from test_db_plugin to test_ml2_plugin.

    Do not add DHCP info to subnet if DHCP is disabled
    
    Currently the midonet plugin will add default DHCP information to
    each subnet even if the subnet is configured to have DHCP disabled.
    This change addresses this by checking the DHCP settings while
    creating a subnet, and only adding DHCP information if DHCP is
    enabled.

    Handle IPAddressGenerationFailure during get_dhcp_port
    
    If a network/subnet is deleted while the dhcp agent is trying
    to get/create a dhcp port for that network, the exception
    will be raised because no IP Allocation Range is available.
    
    However, this particular failure mode causes just noise, because
    the dhcp agent can cope with it without problems.
    
    A follow-up patch will deal with the other exception traces during
    create_dhcp_port

    Enable polling minimization
    
    In some cases the OVS agent might end up wiring a port for a VM
    several seconds after the VM has booted. As a result, there is a
    risk that the VM won't receive an IP address from DHCP in time.
    
    This patch changes the default value for agent.minimize_polling to
    True. This change should reduce the time needed for configuring
    an interface on br-int consistently.

    Add configurable ovsdb monitor respawn interval
    
    If minimize_polling=True and the ovsdb-client process died, the
    default respawn interval of 0 would mean that we'd start polling
    again. This patch adds the option ovsdb_monitor_respawn_interval and
    defaults it to 30 seconds.

    Added check on plugin.supported_extension_aliases
    
    Added check to neutron.api.extensions.PluginAwareExtensionManager
    which raises an exception when an alias in the plugin's
    `supported_extension_aliases` list is not found in the set of loaded
    extension aliases. If an alias is missing, it means the extension for
    that alias has not been loaded, has not been found, and the file is
    missing from paths listed in `oslo.config.CONF.api_extensions_path`.
    
    This guards against a common class of bugs in plugins,
    such as typographical errors in the `supported_extension_aliases`
    property.
    
    Plugin changes:
    
    * bigswitch.plugin: Moves api_extensions_path override to plugin's
    __init__ method, similar to other plugins.
    
    * cisco.n1kv.n1kv_neutron_plugin: Removes "policy_profile_binding" and
    "network_profile_binding" as they don't exist in Neutron currently.
    Removed override of api_extensions_path as it is loaded through
    cisco.network_plugin.
    
    * cisco.network_plugin: Renames "Cisco Credential" to "credential".
    Adds api_extension_path override to plugin's __init__ method.
    
    * metaplugin.meta_neutron_plugin: Avoids alias of empty string when
    cfg.CONF.META.supported_extension_aliases is an empty string.
    
    * midonet.plugin: Fixes regression of 98e16a06 from 715b16ac.
    
    * nec.nec_plugin: Extended override of api_extensions_path to append
    nec extensions path to existing configured path.
    
    * nicira.NeutronPlugin: Extended override of api_extensions_path to
    append NXP_EXT_PATH to existing configured path.

    Cisco nexus plugin fails to untrunk vlan if other hosts using vlan
    
    Closes-Bug: #1246080
    
    Without this fix, if two or more compute hosts have
    instances which are
    sharing a given VLAN on a Nexus switch, and then
    all instances on one of the hosts which are using that
    VLAN are terminated, while instances which are using
    that VLAN on other hosts remain active, then
    the VLAN is not being untrunked from the
    corresponding interface on the Nexus switch as
    expected.
    
    This fix changes the VLAN removal logic from:
    ----If this the last instance using this VLAN on this switch:
    --------untrunk the vlan from the switch interface
    --------delete the VLAN from the switch
    To:
    ----If this the last instance using this VLAN on this switch interface:
    --------untrunk the vlan from the switch interface
    --------If this the last instance using this VLAN on this switch:
    ------------delete the VLAN from the switch
    
    Note that this bug also exists in the Cisco ML2
    mechanism driver, but the code which implements
    this is being redesigned, so it will be addressed for
    the ML2 separately.

    and agent's networks, networks may have already

    Round-robin SVI switch selection fails on Cisco Nexus plugin
    
    Fixes bug 1250969
    
    This fix addresses improper behavior with the Cisco Nexus plugin's
    selection of Nexus switch on which to place a Switch Virtual Interface
    (SVI) when round-robin switch placement is enabled.
    
    The expected behavior when round-robin SVI switch selection is configured
    via the cisco_plugins.ini file, i.e.:
        [cisco]
        nexus_l3_enable = True
        svi_round_robin = True
    is that when a virtual router interface is created, the Nexus plugin should
    select the Nexus switch with the least number of SVI interfaces configured
    for creating the new SVI. The current selection is based on the first
    entry in a dictionary, and is therefore indeterminate.
    
    Similarly, this fix also addresses incorrect behavior when round-robin
    selection is disabled. In this case, the desired behavior is that
    the plugin should select the first switch which appears in the Nexus
    switch configuration. Instead, the current selection is also based on the
    first entry in a dictionary, and is likewise indeterminate.

    Tune up report and downtime intervals for l2 agent
    
    If the neutron server erroneously thinks than the l2 agent is down
    it will fail to bind a port, which can lead to VM's spawn errors.
    However, the issue is only transient because the agent effectively
    is only 'late' in reporting back.
    
    Best solution would be an alpha-count algorithm (so that we can detect
    persistent failures more reliably), but for now let's be more tolerant
    assuming that the agent is down by waiting at least twice the report
    interval plus a tiny teeny bit.

    Fix DB integrity issues when using postgres
    
    The IntegrityError faced on network deletion that
    spooks Tempest tests is most likely caused by the
    fact that the ml2 plugin does a dirty read. By
    adding a 'select for update' we should be able to
    address the issue once and for all.
    
    Also, there's a chance that the dhcp port gets
    reallocated while we are deleting the network. To
    this aim, catch the integrity error and attempt
    to recover from it.
    
    This patch also removes the handling of errors
    on concurrent reads that can no longer occur when
    deleting the network.
    
    (Hopefully) Closes-bug: #1239637

    Arista ML2 mech driver cleanup and integration with portbindings
    
    fixes bug: 1215097
    
    This patch addresses minor cleanups which are the diff between the
    original version of the patch which was merged into havana master
    branch and the patch that is submitted for merge into stable/havana.
    
    The original patch that was merged into havana master branch is at:
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/49086/
    The new patch which has been submitted as havana-backport-potential is:
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54447/
    
    This whole excercise came into play because the original patch was not
    picked up in havana-rc2 because of missing tag in the bug. Therefore, the
    need to submit new patch against stable/havana.
    
    When the new patch was submitted for havana-backport-potential, few very
    minor previously commented cleanups were incorporated as well. This
    patch brings these minor cleanups into master branch as well. Therefore,
    merge of these two patches will bring both master branch and
    stable/havana at parity.

    Remove the warning for Scheduling Network
    
    when a new port is created, the schedule_network in agentschedulers_db is called.
    Since this network may already be hosted, it will directly return None in dhcp_agent_scheduler,
    which cause the agentschedulers_db.schedule_network log a warning message.
    
    This is really annoying and making users confused.
    And, real warnings are already addressed in the real scheduler function.
    which is neutron.scheduler.dhcp_agent_scheduler.ChanceScheduler.schedule by default.

    Refactor configuring of floating ips on a router
    
    This approach to configuring floating ips is stateless and idempotent.
    This allows it to handle corner cases, such as reusing a floating ip
    address with a different floating ip id in a way that is easier to
    understand.
    
    The concept is to wipe the floating ips clean and rebuild them each
    time with the following optimizations.  To avoid bad performance in

    Avoid dhcp agent race condition on subnet and network delete
    
    This patch ensures that, when the dhcp agent queries the server
    to retrieve and delete its DHCP port, it does so by selecting
    for update. This has been done by introducing a new method
    that combines the get and delete in one shot.

    Ensure OVS plugin is loaded in OVS plugin test
    
    In TestOpenvswitchSGServerRpcCallBack and NetworkBindingsTest
    in OVS plugin tests, OVS plugin was not loaded properly.
    
    * For NetworkBindingsTest, it can be fixed by changing setUp()
      to take 'plugin' arguments in the base test classes
      SecurityGroupDBTestCase and SGServerRpcCallBackMixinTestCase.
      This fixes bug 1242510 in ML2 unit tests.
    
    * For NetworkBindingsTest, it can be fixed by passing the plugin
      class to super.setUp(). The test itself needs to be updated
      because network binding is added when a network is created.
    
    * NetworkBindingsTest in Linux Bridge plugin has the same issue,
      so it is also fixed in this patch.

    Remove deprecated fields in keystone auth middleware
    
    This commit makes the following changes:
    
    Use X_PROJECT_ID instead of X_TENANT_ID:
      In the latest keystone auth_token middleware it is recommended to
      use X_PROJECT_ID instead of X_TENANT_ID. X_PROJECT_ID is supported
      in auth_token middleware for both keystone v2 and v3 API.
      The corresponding change was done in keystoneclient before Grizzly
      release, so we don't need to take care of X_TENANT_ID now.
    
    USE X_ROLES instead of X_ROLE:
      X_ROLES is now recommended.
      X_ROLE exists just for diablo backward compatibility.
    
    Remove X_TENANT and X_USER:
      X_TENANT and X_USER are for diablo backward compatibility.
      We no longer need take care of them in Icehouse Neutron.

    NVP: Correct NVP router port mac to match neutron
    
    Previously when router ports were created the mac_address from neutron
    was not passed to nvp so nvp generated it's own mac_address for the port.
    This patch fixes this by passing the mac_address on the port to nvp.

    Support uncompressed ipv6 address and abbreviated ipv4 address
    
    Now neutron supports zero-compressed ipv6 address like
    '2001:db8::10:10:10:0/120' and unabbreviated ipv4 address
    like '10.0.0.0/24'.
    This path will make neutron also support uncompressed ipv6
    address and abbreviated ipv4 address. for example:
    1, uncompressed ipv6 address like 'fe80:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/128'
    2, ipv6 address with multiple consecutive zero like
       '2001:0db8:0:0:1::1/128' or '2001::0:1:0:0:1100/120'
    3, abbreviated ipv4 address like '10/24'

    nvp:log only in rm router iface if port not found
    
    The code currently raises when it's not able to find the port to be
    deleted on the backend. This might happen, for instance, when the
    port is manually removed or, in some cases, if port creation failed
    in the first place.
    
    There's little sense in raising when a resource to be removed is not
    found; therefore this patch replaces the raise statement with a log
    statement.

    Fix IP recycling on exhausted pool
    
    When recycling an IP, allocation pools are loaded with an inner
    join with ip avaiblity ranges. However, if the pool is exhausted,
    there will be no availability ranges and the query will return
    no results because of the inner join. It will therefore be
    impossible to reuse IP addresses once the pool has been exhausted.
    
    This patch tries to reload allocation pools without joining on
    IP avaiability ranges if the first query did not return any result.
    Replacing an inner join with an outer join will not be possible
    as postgresql backend does not support 'SELECT ... FOR UPDATE' with
    outer joins (for more info see bug 1215350).
    
    The patch also contains unit tests for verifying IP are recycled
    correctly even when the pool is exhausted.

    Although underneath this is the eventlet.wsgi.server server, Other
    OpenStack projects, don't use that logger instead they use there own.
    
    This will also mean the wsgi server will stop logging on just the
    warning level.  We want wsgi server to at least log on info level
    so it will log when a request is processed and what the return code is.

    Add port bindings to ports created in Midonet
    
    Currently Midokura uses its own script (mm-ctl) to bind ports. However, support
    for using this script is left out of the nova and neutron projects. This causes
    confusion and makes deployments unnecessarily complicated for customers using
    Havana. This fix is to change Neutron to properly set up port bindings to use
    the "midonet" vif driver when creating a port. Corresponding changes will be
    submitted to the devstack and Nova projects.

    Add the option to minimize ovs l2 polling
    
    This change adds the ability to monitor the local ovsdb for
    interface changes so that the l2 agent can avoid unnecessary
    polling.  Minimal changes are made to the agent so the risk
    of breakage should be low.  Future efforts to make the agent
    entirely event-based may be able to use OvsdbMonitor as a
    starting point.
    
    By default polling minimization is not done, and can only be
    enabled by setting 'minimize_polling = True' in the ovs
    section of the l2 agent's config file.

    Add support for managing async processes
    
    Interacting with a long-running asynchronous process requires the
    use of non-blocking io.  This change adds a helper class that can
    launch a long-running process and read stdout and stderr in a
    non-blocking fashion via eventlet.
    
    This functionality is intended to support monitoring ovsdb via
    a long-running and root-privileged invocation of ovsdb-client.
    
    The complexity of the system interaction in this patch suggested
    the addition of a functional test that validated actual behaviour.
    The test was added under the neutron/tests/functional path which
    is now included in the testr search path.

    cisco/nexus plugin doesn't create port for router interface
    
    Fixes bug 1234826
    
    This fix adds a "nexus_l3_enable" configuration boolean for the
    Cisco Nexus plugin. When this config boolean is set to False (default),
    then the Nexus switches are only used for L2 switching/segmentation, and
    layer 3 functionality is deferred to the OVS subplugin / network
    control node. If this config boolean is set to True, layer 3
    functionality, e.g. switch virtual interfaces, are supported on
    the Nexus switches. (Note that layer 3 functionality is not supported
    on all versions/models Nexus switches.)
    
    Some other things addressed with this fix:
    - The l3_port_check keyword argument which is optionally passed to the
      Cisco plugin's delete_port method was not being forwarded on to the
      OVS (sub) plugin. This keyword argument needs to be forwarded to OVS
      e.g. when the delete_port is being done in the context of a
      router interface delete (whereby l3_port_check==False).
    - UT test cases are added for new "nexus_l3_enable" config, which
      exercise router interface add/delete.
    - The Cisco test_network_plugin.py module is refactored/reorganized
      in order to cleanly add a new router interface test class.
    - The test_model_update_port_rollback test case was yielding a false
      positive result (device_owner was not being passed to self.port).

    Fix auto-deletion of ports when deleting subnets in ML2
    
    When a subnet is deleted, certain ports referencing it are
    auto-deleted. The implementation of NeutronDBPluginV2.delete_subnet()
    does this at the DB level, so ML2's mechanism drivers were not being
    called.
    
    Ml2Plugin.delete_subnet() is changed to not use the base class's
    method, and to auto-delete ports by calling its own delete_port()
    method outside of the transaction. A loop avoids race conditions with
    ports being asynchronously added to the subnet.
    
    The logic in Ml2Plugin.delete_network() is also fixed to properly
    handle auto-deleting ports and subnets, and debug logging is added to
    the various delete methods.

    Simplify using external routers and metadata
    
    The dhcp agent only pushes out the metadata
    static route when the subnet is isolated, and it
    determines that by checking if the gateway_ip is
    not set. This makes it tricky to use external
    routers and metadata from dhcp at the same time.
    
    This patch changes how the dhcp agent determines
    that the subnet is isolated. It now considers it
    isolated if there is no Neutron router on it.
    This makes it straightforward to use an external
    router on a provider network and get the
    metadata from the dhcp namespace.

    Fix dhcp_release lease race condition
    
    There is a possible race condition when delete or updating fixed_ips
    on ports where an instance could renew its ip address again after
    dhcp_release has already been executed. To fix this, the order of
    reload_allocation and release_lease need to be switched. This way an
    instance will not be able to renew it's ip address after it is
    removed from the host file.

    Prevent L3 agent looping calls from hanging
    
    This patch adopts several measures to prevent _sync_routers_task
    and _rpc_loop from hanging because of subprocess.Popen.communicate
    not returning.
    
    1) Perform a sleep everytime a command is completed, similarly to
    what is done in openstack.common.processutils.execute
    2) Disable by default GARP, as kernel crashes caused by arping
    have been observed
    3) Prevent a non-critical keyerror in _router_removed from triggering
    again a full sync, which might put the system under significant load.
    
    This patch also adds debug log statements aimed at improving the
    ability of debugging similar failures.

    Enable Quota DB driver by default
    
    Closes-Bug: #1189671
    
    Quota driver is now loaded in lazy mode, i.e. the driver is loaded
    the first time the driver is accessed. This is to make unit tests
    work. Some unit tests like extension test cases need to use Config
    Quota driver (previous default) but QuotaEngine is initialized
    when quota.py is imported. Thus the unit tests had no chance to
    specify quota_driver.

    field) is no longer included in RPC messages from the linuxbridge and
    mlnx plugins to their corresponding L2 agents. This can be set to True
    if needed to support L2 agents older than midway through the havana
    cycle.

    NEC plugin: Fix nec-agent unexpected exit due to RPC exception
    
    Changes nec-agent to catch RPC exceptions in the main
    daemon loop. It fixes the following two bugs.
    
    - nec-agent dies with RPC timeout in secgroup RPC
      (Closes-Bug: #1235106)
    
    - port_added message can be dropped when RPC timeout occurs
      (Closes-Bug: #1235111). Moves exception catch from PluginApi
      to the main daemon loop.

    Add a route to reach the MD server when a subnet is created
    
    When the first subnet is created, the dhcp port is created and
    midonet plugin correctly adds the static route to reach the MD
    server in create_port. When a second or following subnets are
    created, a new ip is added to the dhcp port. This patch takes
    care of adding the static route to correcly reach the MD server
    in update_port. This fixes the problem of VMs not being able to
    reach the MD if assigned to the second subnet

    Should not add metadata filter rules if disable metadata proxy
    
    The metadata filter rules should not be added into iptables if Neutron
    metadata proxy is disabled.
    This patchset fixes this issue by adding a condition when adding metadata
    filter rules to iptables.

    Fix auto-deletion of ports and subnets in ML2
    
    When a network is deleted, certain ports and any subnets referencing
    it are auto-deleted. The implementation of
    NeutronDBPluginV2.delete_network() does this at the DB level, so ML2's
    mechanism drivers were not being called.
    
    Ml2Plugin.delete_network() is changed to not use the base class's
    method, and to auto-delete ports and subnets by calling its own
    delete_port() and delete_subnet() methods outside of the
    transaction. A loop avoids race conditions with ports or subnets being
    asynchronously added to the network.

    Fix to enable delete of firewall in PENDING_CREATE state
    
    Firewall will in PENDING_CREATE state if there is no underlying router in the
    tenant. When the router and an associated i/f is created then with a sequence
    of msgs it is set to ACTIVE state by the plugin. If a delete is triggered when
    in PENDING_CREATE state in such a situation, the msg was ignored - fixing this to
    account for the fact that a delete makes sense in this situation so the agent
    sends the appropriate msg back to the plugin so it can delete it.

    Redefine behavior for NvpAdvancedPlugin during network creation
    
    When using the NvpAdvancedPlugin, *all* logical switches should
    be created through VCNS. VCNS will then proxy the requests to
    NVP. This patch implements such a behavior. This is achieved by
    replacing the use of nvplib.create_lswitch with the one of the
    vcns driver, as the remaining logic can be left as it is.

    Port Cisco nexus subplugin UT to ML2 mech driver UT
    
    Fixes bug 1227889
    
    This fix ports the Cisco Nexus sub-plugin unit tests
    (neutron/tests/unit/cisco/test_nexus_plugin.py) to the Cisco ML2 mechanism
    driver. The new test script will be
    neutron/tests/unit/ml2/drivers/test_cisco_nexus.py.
    
    Test cases which will be excluded from this port:
        - Test cases involving provider networks.
        - Test cases involving add/remove router networks
    since these features are not currently supported in the Cisco ML2
    mechanism driver.

    Fix FWaaS plugin to allow one firewall per tenant
    
    The reference implementation of the FWaaS iptables
    agent/driver supports only one firewall per tenant
    in Havana release. However, the FWaaS plugin will
    let you create more than one firewall. This is
    being fixed in this patch to not allow creating
    the second firewall if a firewall already exists
    for the tenant.

    Handle long integer conversion in NEC portinfo validation tests
    
    There are a couple of tests for NEC portinfo validation that pass an id
    which gets converted to a base-16 integer and then that gets converted
    to a hex string. The problem is the integer conversion can make it a
    long integer and then the hex built-in appends 'L' to the string, and
    the tests do not account for that. This patch handles that case.

    Port Cisco nexus and network db UT to ML2 mech driver UT
    
    Fixes bug 1227964
    
    This fix ports the Cisco Nexus database and network database
    unit tests to the Cisco ML2 mechanism driver UT.
    The existing test scripts which are ported:
        neutron/tests/unit/cisco/test_nexus_db.py
        neutron/tests/unit/cisco/test_network_db.py
    The new test scripts are:
        neutron/tests/unit/ml2/drivers/test_cisco_nexus_db.py
        neutron/tests/unit/ml2/drivers/test_cisco_network_db.py
    
    Note that the QoS database related tests in
    test_network_db.py are not ported because QoS is
    not currently supported in the Cisco ML2
    mechanism driver.

    Creates multiple worker processes for API server
    
    This change to the WSGI code uses openstack.common.service to create
    multiple worker processes to handle API load.  The main process will
    start up a configurable (workers=??) number of child processes which
    will all listen on the bind port.  The main process becomes the parent
    and manages the children.  The parent is not a worker.
    
    Backwards compatibility is preserved by setting api_workers to 0, the
    default.  In this case, no separate worker processes are spawned and
    the worker threads run in the main process.
    
    Implement blueprint multi-workers-for-api-server

    Fix for status always in PENDING_CREATE for Edge service router
    
    The root cause is when deployment finished, we only update router status to
    active if the status is in pending create. The problem happens when the
    background sync thread update router status to active, so the status update
    for vcns_router_binding table is skipped. We fixed this by seperating
    checking and updating status for router and binding table.
    
    Also fixed an issue where Edge is not deleted if neutron service is
    restarted. The root cause is when neutron service restarts, the cache for
    router type is empty. And because we delete the router from db before
    we delete Edge, we're not able to locate the router from db to determine
    the router type. The fix is to use binding table to determine the router
    type.
    
    Also piggyback a missing attribute for updating Edge interface. It must have
    been removed by accident when resolving conflict during service plugin merge.

    FWaaS - fix reordering of rules in policy
    
    Due to a recent change, reodering of rules within the
    same policy was failing. This is fixed by checking if
    the rules belong to the same policy we allow reordering.
    
    There was also a missing call to reorder due to which
    the position number on the rules was not reflected correctly
    after the reordering. This is also fixed.

    Port binding registration with NeutronDbPlugin causes Neutron crash
    
    fixes bug: 1226169
    
    port binding feature of ML2 plugin registers a callback function with
    db_base_plugin_v2.NeutronDbPluginV2, which is invoked during a query of
    port DB. This function is registered by name instead by refefence. This
    causes wrong context to be passed to the function upon invocation, which
    causes the exception. If this query is made during neutron
    initilization, Neutron service will fail to start.
    
    This fix changes the registration from function name to function
    pointer

    There were a few calls to update the network on the backend
    that were not having the context passed to them so they were

    by passing the context to all network update calls. It also
    disallows calls to _send_update_network that don't provide

    Support advanced NVP LBaaS Service
    
    The patch adds NVP advanced LBaaS service support for NVP with
    VCNS:
            * NVP LBaaS is an advanced Service of NVP depending on NVP
              advanced service router
                - Once an advanced router id created, one corresponding
                  vshield edge will be deployed, and then we can configure
                  LB service On the vshield edge
            * NVP LBaaS service plugin still uses LBaaS DB service logic,
              while finally calling vShield Edge to support FWaaS service
                - When creating VIP object, service attaches the object to
                  the advanced router with routedserviceinsertion service.
                  Then before pushing VIP VCNS call, the server would first
                  pushing associated POOL VCNS call and associated Monitor
                  VCNS call to vShield Edge. Deleting VIP is opposite
                  operation
                - Refering to CUD operation of other objects, service would
                  first find the associated VIP object and then find the edge bound to
                  the router which vip inserted. Then service would push corresponding
                  VCNS call to Vshield Edge

    Support for NVP advanced FwaaS service
    
    The patch adds advanced FWaaS service support for NVP with
    VCNS:
            * NVP FWaaS is an advanced Service of NVP depending on NVP
              advanced service router
                - Once an advanced router id created, one corresponding
                  vshield edge will be deployed, and then we can configure
                  FW service on the vshield edge
            * NVP FWaaS service plugin still uses FWaaS DB service logic,
              while finally calling vShield Edge to support FWaaS service
                - When firewall object is created, we will attach the
                  object to the advanced router with routedserviceinsertion_db
                  service
            * on driver part, the driver will first convert the object
              to VSM known object input, and then send a synchronous JSON
              calling to VSM, and receive the result

    Avoid race with udev during ovs agent startup
    
    After taking down the veth link between the physical bridge and the integration
    bridge call udevadm settle to wait for any udev events to be completely
    processed by the operating system before recreating the veth pair.
    
    Some distributions (e.g. openSUSE) have udev rules installed by default that
    call e.g. ifdown <interface> during the remove event. If that is processed
    after the ovs agent already brought up the veth pair again the veth pair's
    link will be down after the agent completed startup and networking will be
    broken for all VM instances.

    _validate_network_tenant_ownership must be less strict
    
    Neutron, currently does a strict validation code
    so that for non-shared network the subnets and
    ports must belong to the same tenant as the network. In
    the case of a "service VM" created by
    admin user, this function should return thus allowing
    admin users to create ports and networks in a tenant
    network.

    FWaaS - fix policy association of firewall rule
    
    If an existing firewall rule already associated with a
    firewall policy is associated with a different firewall
    policy, the new association should fail. The check for
    the existing association was not being made, hence the
    firewall rule was being removed from the older policy
    and being associated with the newer policy (incorrect
    behavior). This is being fixed here.
    
    If the association with the newer policy has to be made
    the rule should first be removed from the existing policy
    association.

    Use same hostname function as nova
    
    Certain plugin implementations of port binding depend on the port's
    binding:host_id set by nova matching the compute node's hostname
    reported by neutron agents in agents_db. Nova uses
    socket.gethostname() to obtain the hostname, so this changes neutron
    to also use socket.gethostname(), instead of socket.getfqdn() to
    obtain the default hostname. If deployments require a specific
    hostname format or value, the hostname can be specified in nova and
    neutron configuration files.

    Prevent stale DHCP directories for dhcp agent nodes
    
    This change fixes an issue that is most acute in test/dev
    environments but that may affect production environments
    as well: the presence of DHCP directories that no longer
    represent networks that exist in the Neutron DB. This
    issue can manifest itself over time if you delete networks
    from the Server while the Agent node is down.
    
    Without this fix, at the agent start-up the method
    existing_dhcp_networks will return an empty list, and
    as a consequence the directories that belong to networks
    that have been removed from the server will stay because
    the sync logic will not process them as it only looks at
    the mismatch between active networks on the agent and
    active networks on the server. With the fix instead, we
    return *all* existing dhcp networks; if they are meant to
    be active, the agent will bring them up, if they no longer
    exist on the server, then the agent will dispose of the
    resources. The dnsmasq driver will do the right thing when
    enabling or disabling the process.

    Fix handling of floating IP association info in Nicira plugin
    
    Bug 1223902
    
    This patch fixes the _update_fix_assoc routine in the Nicira plugin,
    ensuring the association of a floating IP with a router is removed
    when the floating IP is disassociated.
    This patch also adds a unit test for validating behaviour when a floating
    IP is associated to a port on a different router, which was an
    uncovered use case. This new unit test required some refactoring in
    test_l3_plugin.py.

    Enhance exception translation to better handle NeutronExceptions
    
    NeutronExceptions have a 'message' class attribute that holds the
    generic error message template, e.g. "Network %(network)s not found",
    unfortunately, because the names are the same, it was overshadowing the
    actual exception instance 'message', e.g. "Network 1 not found", after
    translation when the exception was serialized to JSON.
    
    This patch puts the exception's actual message in a new field called
    'msg' and overwrites NeutronException unicode() so that 'msg' is used
    during serialization and we'll get the correct message on the REST API
    response.

    Vxlan / L2population support to Linuxbridge Agent
    
    This patch introduces VXLAN support for Linuxbridge agent alongside
    with ml2 plugin support in linubridge mechnism driver.
    
    A new vxlan configuration section is added for vxlan related parameters.
    
    The agent also implements l2population RPC callbacks which allows ml2
    plugin using l2population mechnism driver to populate vxlan forwarding
    and neighbor tables following portbinding events. It allows agent to
    respond locally to ARP requests for remote VMs and avoid dataplane based
    learning. This should help limiting the use of multicast or flooding
    for broadcast emulation in vxlan networks.
    
    These changes should anyway have a limited risk, as agent behaviour
    shouldn't be affected, except when vxlan is enabled alongside ml2 plugin.
    
    Implements: blueprint l2-population

    OVS agent implementation of l2-population
    
    This patchset implements l2-population RPC callbacks in OVS agents,
    it enables plugin to populate forwarding table following portbindings
    events.
    
    For now, it doesn't include ARP responder implementation which is
    deferred to a future patchset (As this feature isn't yet supported by
    OVS, it will require the use of an external responder such as ebtables)
    
    It anyway brings some improvements in tunnelling management, as agent
    will tear-down unecessary tunnels, and flood packets on a per-network
    basis rather than to all other agents.
    
    These changes should anyway have a limited risk, as tunnel management
    won't be affected as long as l2_population option is not set. This
    option must be used in conjonction with ml2 plugin using l2population
    mechanism driver.

    Adds help text to brocade configuration options
    
    Help text was added to the configuration options defined in the brocade neutron
    plugin. This help text should assist users of the brocade plugin. The OSTYPE
    configuration option was not used in the plugin and was labeled as such so a
    user of the plugin would not worry about the meaning of it.
    
    The example etc file /etc/neutron/plugins/brocade/brocade.ini has been updated
    to share the same help values where applicable.

    Change daemon Pidfile class to not use root_helper
    
    Some users of the Pidfile class don't specify root_helper,
    which then defaults to 'sudo', which will generate an error.
    Remove root_helper altogether since we actually don't need
    root priveleges to read /proc/$pid/cmdline.
    
    Changed code to use open.readline() instead of a shell, and
    tweaked tests accordingly.
    
    Also cleaned-up the rootwrap filters that allow it as they
    are not used anymore.

    Ensure pid file is removed when metadata ns daemon receives SIGTERM
    
    These files from the metadata namespace proxy are not being removed
    because delete_pid() is registered with atexit. This means it only runs
    when a process exits normally and won't run when a process receives a
    signal.
    
    This patch registers a signal handler for SIGTERM that calls exit()
    to make the process exit normally so delete_pid() gets called.
    
    Fixes bug: 1223250

    In 'disassociate' operation neutron API layer works with
    PoolHealthMonitorAssociation which doesn't have tenant_id field.

    Fix IF checks on spawned green thread instance
    
    Initially the symptom looks like race condition between two threads when
    stopping the task manager. After further analysis/troubleshooting, it
    turns out that two threads are spawned if a task manager is stopped and
    started again, causing unexpected errors.
    
    The IF check on the spawned thread sometimes return True sometime return False
    if not compared against None explicitly. This makes start() method
    think no thread has been started or stop() method think no thread is started.
    Change the check to compare against None.
    
    Also fixed a problem in unit-test where a thread may never terminated when
    a stop call is invoked during db access.

    Prevents 400 NVP errors caused by a None display_name
    
    The API forbids a resource name to be None, but the
    Model does not. Such errors may  be induced by
    programming directly against the plugin interface. With
    this fix we avoid raising 400 faults which may be introduced
    by involuntary programming errors.

    Hash device_id only if it is longer than the allowed MAX size for NVP
    
    This ensure that a VM uuid stays untouched, avoiding potential
    confusion when inspecting NVP port tags. This patch also abstracts
    the hashing method out by introducing a device_id_to_vm_id method.
    Filtering logic is preserved, and a test has been added to ensure
    that. However such a logic is not currently used in the NeutronPlugin
    (because of the introduction of async status updates), but it has
    been added as utility method to nvplib.

    Move declaration of int_br_device_count earlier
    
    _report_state is being called by setup_rpc so int_br_device_count needs
    to be initialized earlier. To avoid
    AttributeError: object has no attribute 'int_br_device_count'
    
    This wasn't caught by unit tests for 3 separate reason
    o The reference to self.int_br_device_count is wrapped in
      except Exception: log / pass
    - This reference has been moved outside of the try/except
    
    o Unit tests set report_interval to 0 so the heartbeat wasn't called
      during unit tests.
    - now removed
    
    o The function passed into FixedIntervalLoopingCall isn't started
      anyways so wasn't calling self._report_state
    - replaced FixedIntervalLoopingCall with a mock that calls the
      function once.
    
    Fixes bug #1221054

    Implement Allowed Address Pairs
    
    The following patch adds the concept of allowed address pairs.
    This allows one to add additional ip/mac address pairs on a port to
    allow traffic that matches those specified values. This is useful in order
    to leverage dataplane failover mechanisms like vrrp. This patch adds support
    for the NVP plugin, the OVS plugin, and Ml2.

    OpenFlow distributed router support in NEC plugin
    
    Implements blueprint nec-distribute-router
    
    Two types of neutron router will be supported: l3-agent and distributed.
    A type can be specified through "provider" attribute of a router.
    The naming of the attribute "provider" is intentional since I plan to
    support the service provider framework for router in the future and
    would like to make it easy to migrate.
    
    distributed router in NEC OpenFLow controller now does not support NAT,
    so l3-agent and distributed router coexists. To achieve it, l3-agent
    scheudler logic is modified in NEC plugin to exclude distributed routers
    from candidates of floating IP hosting routers.
    
    To support the above feature, the following related changes are done:
    - Adds a new driver to PFC driver which supports OpenFlow based router
      support in NEC OpenFlow products in PFlow v5.
    - Update ofc_client to extract detail error message
      from OpenFlow controller
    
    This commit also changes the following outside of NEC plugin:
    - Makes L3 agent notifiers configurable.
      l3-agent router and OpenFlow distributed router can coexist.
      Notication to l3-agent should be done only when routers are
      hosted by l3-agent, so we need custom L3 agent notifiers
      to filter non l3-agent routers.
    - Split test_agent_scheduler base class (in OVS plugin) into
      the base setup and testcases. By doing so we can implement
      custom testcases related to agent scheduler.

    Introduce periodic state synchronization with backend
    
    Blueprint nicira-plugin-get-improvements
    
    With this patch GET operations on the Nicira plugin will not
    be forwarded anymore to the NVP backend.
    Resource operational status will be periodically retrieved from
    the NVP backend using a DynamicLoopingCall.
    The process has been designed with the aim of avoiding:
    1) frequent queries to NVP for retrieving resource status
    2) execution of large queries to NVP for retrieving the status
       of a consistent number of resources.
    The process can be tuned using a set of configuration variables.
    GET operations will now return a status which might differ
    from the actual status of the resource. For retrieving status
    in a punctual way, the field 'status' should be explicitly
    specified in the GET request (only 'show' support has been
    implemented in this patch)
    
    This patchs also makes some changes to the fake nvp api client in
    order to ensure each instance has a private set of dictionaries for
    fake nvp entities.

    Verify MTU is valid for ipsec_site_connection
    
    Since the check relies on the vpnservice subnet to determine whether
    this is IPv4 ro IPv6, we must check in the plugin. Test is done at
    create/update time and ensures that the MTU is equal to or greater
    than the minimum allowed values, which are set to 68 for IPv4
    minimum and 1280 for IPv6, respectively.
    
    Refactored code to allow reuse of create and update test functions,
    by allowing tests to override some settings, and to provide a dict
    of changed items (for update).

    Implement ML2 port binding
    
    The ml2 plugin uses mechanism drivers to determine which network
    segment and what VIF driver to use for a port. Mechanism drivers
    supporting the openvswitch, linuxbridge, and hyperv agents are
    added. The binding:host attribute is set on ports belonging to the
    dhcp and l3 agents so that they can be bound.
    
    To use with devstack until it is updated, set
    "Q_ML2_PLUGIN_MECHANISM_DRIVERS=openvswitch,linuxbridge" in localrc.
    
    The hyperv L2 agent does not currently implement the agents_db RPC,
    and will therefore not work with its ml2 mechanism driver. This issue
    will be tracked as a bug to be fixed in a separate merge.
    
    implements blueprint: ml2-portbinding

    Refactoring for nicira plugin to support NVP DHCP/Metadata services
    
    This initial patch is aimed at decoupling core plugin services from
    DHCP and metadata services. The abstraction being introduced is
    needed so that the code can support both models where dhcp and
    metadata services are provided by external RPC agents or solely by
    the server-side plugin.
    
    Supports blueprint nvp-dhcp-metadata-services

    ML2 type and mech managers should use instance vars for drivers lists
    
    Fixes bug 1220296
    
    The ML2 plugin's type and mechanism managers currently maintain
    dictionaries/lists of type drivers, mechanism drivers, and ordered mechanism
    drivers in (static) class variables. Once a type/mechanism/ordered-mechanism
    driver of any given type is added to this list, then no new drivers of that
    type are allowed to be registered, and therefore no new configuration for
    that driver type is accepted.
    
    This static nature of the driver dictionaries/lists is causing ML2 mechanism
    driver unit test cases to fail. For example, if a non-vendor-specific ML2
    plugin test case configures a VLAN type driver with no VLAN range, and then
    a vendor specific test case attempts to configure a VLAN type driver with
    some test VLAN range, then the new VLAN configuration is ignored because of
    the previously (staticly) registered VLAN driver.
    
    The proposed fix is to convert these driver dictionaries/lists to instance
    variables, and clear them upon each instantiation of an ML2 type manager
    or ML2 mechanism manager.

    Allow subclasses to modify dict_extend hooks
    
    Partial-Bug 1219991
    
    This change modifies the hook processing for dict_extend routines
    to call the method on the instance if a hook is registered as a string.
    Otherwise, the callable hook is directly invoked as an unbound method.
    
    This patch fixes hook registration for all extensions except port_binding.
    This is because some plugins are currently working around this limitation
    by invoking both the global hook and another dict_extend function,
    which might either be registered as another hook, or invoked explicitly
    before returning the response.
    Fixing this would go beyong the scope of this patch.

    Make Neutron NVP plugin future-versions friendly
    
    This patch enables the plugin to deal correctly with
    newer versions of the NVP platform; this is done by
    allowing the plugin to fall back to the closest known
    version of the NVP platform. This is acceptable behavior
    as L2/L3 operations implemented by the platform are most
    certainly backward compatible.
    
    This patch also improves test coverage for this part of the
    code, which is critical to the correct behavior of the plugin.

    Refactor BigSwitch error handling to use db rollbacks
    
    This patch adjusts most of the logic handling the
    calls to the controller in the BigSwitch/floodlight
    plugin to make use of the db rollbacks from
    sqlalchemy for free on exceptions. This eliminates
    several complex try-except blocks and makes
    maintaining db<->controller consistency easier.

    On startup, the agent removes and readds flows to the OVS bridges.  If
    an RPC setup error exits the process prematurely, this can leave the
    bridges in an unsafe state.  It is better to set the RPC communication
    up before making changes to the host system.

    Correct VPNaaS limit checks in extension
    
    For the following VPNaaS attributes, ensure that these validation
    tests are performed in the extension:
    
        keepalive >= 60 (seconds)
        mtu >= 0 (octets)
        DPD interval > 0 (seconds)
        DPD timeout > 0 (seconds)
    
    Currently, the units for keepalive can only be seconds. If this
    changes in the future (e.g. to allow kilobytes units), then the
    test for the value will need to be changed.
    
    To correctly test the MTU limits for an IPSec connection, the
    protocol must be taken into consideration, which is defined by
    the vpnservice object. Because of this dependency, we cannot
    validate this in the extension, and will instead, just make
    sure the value is positive.
    
    Likewise, the attribute validators cannot ensure that the
    DPD timeout is greater than the interval (again, because the
    validators can only check the individual attributes one at
    a time).
    
    The range validator was modified to allow single ended ranges
    for some of these attributes. The range also ensures the value
    is an integer.
    
    Companion changes are being made in the CLI code for these limit
    changes.
    
    Update: Fixed typo causing tox failure.

    Fix a race condition in add_tunnel_endpoint()
    
    If there are multiple OVS agents concurrently executing
    'tunnel_sync' RPC call a race condition can occur
    leading to insertion of two different TunnelEndpoint
    entries having the same 'id' value.
    
    Unfortunately, we can not rely on:
      - @lockutils.synchronized(), because a Neutron installation can use
        more than one API node
      - with_lockmode('update'), because it works differently in PostgreSQL
        comparing to MySQL and doesn't guarantee that no new rows have been
        added to the table since the select query was issued. Please take a
        look at http://www.postgresql.org/files/developer/concurrency.pdf for
        more details.
    
    The proposed fix:
      - ensures there is a unique constraint set for 'id' column
      - wraps creation of a new TunnelEndpoint entry into a
        repeatedly executed transactional block (so even if a concurrent
        DB transaction has been flushed or commited earlier than this one
        we can handle an integrity error and try again, in spite of the
        specified transactions isolation level value)
    
    Fixes bug 1167916

    Forbid update of subnet gateway ip when in use by a port
    
    Bug 1186322
    
    If a port is currently using the subnet's gateway IP, which usually
    happens for router interfaces, do not allow updates to the gateway IP.
    This patch adds an extra query on the IPAllocation model, which
    returns at most a single record, and is executed in _validate_subnet
    only when the subnet is updated.

    Allow for skipping admin roles loading on context creation
    
    Bug 1216866
    
    There are cases in which an admin context is created only to grab a db
    session and ensure no tenant filters are applied in _model_query. In
    these cases evaluating the policy engine for grabbing admin roles is not
    necessary, and can cause unexpected and serious issues if the context is
    grabbed before all the extensions are loaded.

    Fix incorrect usage of assertTrue()
    
    The usage of assertTrue() is incorrect, more explicit assert
    from the unit test suite(like assertIsNotNone or assertIn)
    should be used instead.

    Adds support for the Hyper-V WMI V2 namespace
    
    Blueprint: hyper-v-wmi-v2
    
    The Hyper-V APIs are mainly based on WMI. The original 2008 Hyper-V
    release introduced the "root\virtualization" namespace which got
    superseded in Hyper-V Server / Windows Server 2012 by the
    "root\virtualization\v2" namespace (referred as V2 in the sources).
    
    The original namespace has been dropped in the upcoming Hyper-V 2012
    R2 (currently available in preview), which means that the Grizzly code
    will not be compatible with it as is.
    
    The Hyper-V driver is structured with a clear decoupling between OS
    interaction classes (so called *utils modules and classes) and the
    agent's logic.
    
    This allows us to provide an implementation of the V2 API without
    impacting the rest of the agent's code, based on a factory module
    added to instantiate the proper version of the *utils classes: the
    original "V1" ones for versions of the OS predating 2012 and the
    newer "V2" ones starting from Hyper-V 2012 (Windows kernel version
    6.2).

    Analyze re-raised exceptions in Cisco Plugin
    
    Checked all cases of re-raised exceptions. In several cases, the exception
    was redundant (re-raising the same exception), so the try block and
    exception handling was removed.
    
    In one case, exceptions raised from two sources were re-raised with a
    a different exception. Instead of doing this, the original exceptions
    were changed and the try block and re-raised exception were removed.
    
    In cases where there were database exceptions that were re-raised as
    Neutron exceptions, the traceback was left as-is, since it was more
    informative to know the higher level source of the issue.
    
    The same was true for the exception mentioned in the bug, where the
    original failure was in the ncclient library parsing the configuration
    and it would be more descriptive to know that there was a connection
    failure or a config failure, that to know the library method.

    Minimize ovs l2 agent calls to get_vif_port_set()
    
    The ovs l2 agent was previously calling get_vif_port_set() on the
    integration bridge once per rpc_loop() iteration and then again in
    the periodic _report_state() call that returns the current device
    count to the neutron service.  Since get_vif_port_set() is an
    expensive call (relying on shell commands) and since there
    is minimal risk associated with reporting stats that are a few
    seconds old, this patch caches the device count for reuse by
    _report_state().

    Improve dhcp agent structure to support multiple dhcp models
    
    This patch introduces some minor refactoring of the dhcp
    code so that it is easy to support both an in-node/same
    process dhcp provisioning model (e.g. with dnsmasq) and
    proxy model, where DHCP is provided by an external node.
    
    Higher separation of concerns is also achieved by doing
    better data encapsulation.

    Avoid performing extra query for fetching mac learning binding
    
    Bug 1214879
    
    Add a relationship performing eager load in the Port model, thus preventing
    the 'extend' function from performing an extra query.
    This patch also replaces assertTrue with assertEqual in unit tests as it
    needs to evaluate whether the value of the mac_learning_enabled attribute
    is equal to the boolean literal True, whereas assertTrue verifies that the
    expression passed to it evaluates to True. This means that any value but
    False will be enough for the test to pass, which is not correct.

    Separate l3 db tests for l3 agent into their own test case
    
    Bug 1215871
    
    This patch does a simple refactoring of test_l3_plugin, pushing out tests
    aimed at validating the interactions of the l3 agent with the server.
    
    These tests explicitly use TestL3NatPlugin, whereas all the
    other tests use a configurable plugin, which might be specificed by a child
    class. This might lead to confusion and possibly errors in unit tests for
    child classes, especially those not using the l3 agent - for which running
    these test is also superfluous.

    Enable GRE and VXLAN with the same ID
    
    Current packet processing in br-tun is based on tun-id,
    as a consequence, two networks using different tunnel
    types but sharing the same tun-id would not be properly isolated.
    
    To ensure proper isolation within a single bridge, NORMAL action
    can't be used any more as it floods unknown unicasts on all
    bridges ports. It is replaced by a learn action that dynamically
    sets-up flows when packets are recieved from tunnel ports. As mac
    address are learnt in explicit flows (in table 20), we can use a
    default action in that table to flood unknown unicasts to the
    right set of ports, like broadcasts and multicasts packets.
    
    See https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ovs-flow-logic for a more
    detailled explanation of the flow logic
    
    Another alternative could have been to use distinct bridges for
    each tunnel type (whithout modifying the current flow logic),
    but previous alternative may be preferable as it paves the way
    for new tunneling optimisations (like RPC based mac learning and
    partial-mesh flooding proposed in bp/l2-population)

    Validate that, when creating rules specifying a protocol different
    from TCP, UDP, ICMP and ICMPv6, no port (range) is specified because
    NVP does not like it.
    
    The extra validation is specific to the NVP plugin because other
    plugins may choose a different failure mode. For example, the ovs
    plugin does not complain at all, but it just ignores the port range
    if the protocol is not a port-oriented one.

    This patch removes a few explicit policy checks recently added to
    the plumgrid and cisco plugins.
    They are not necessary as the same checks are already performed
    by the policy engine.

    Add ext-gw-mode support to ML2
    
    Closes-Bug: #1212772
    
    ML2 doesn't support ext-gw-mode, resulting in L3 agents not
    setting-up NAT rules in neutron routers (currently, l3 agents
    will assume enable_snat=false if plugin doesn't provide this
    parameter as described in bug 1212868)
    
    This patchset adds the support of ext-gw-mode to ML2 plugin.
    
    In order to support ext-gw-mode alembic migration (as well as
    other potential migrations on plugin dbs), folsom_initial
    migration script is fixed to include ML2 plugin. Otherwise
    databases won't be set-up during migration script (but at
    plugin startup by sqlalchemy), resulting in migration failures.

    Syslog support for neutron metadata proxy
    
    When neutron metadata proxy reads the cli args
    which are propagated from its parent processes
    (l3-agent and dhcp-agent), if log-dir and log-file
    are not defined in the context, it will also
    double-check whether syslog is enabled and
    its facility in the user-defined configuration
    files (/etc/neutron).
    As a result, the log behavior of each neutron
    component becomes consistent.
    File log is the default logging function. The syslog
    is enabled when use_syslog is explicitly defined and
    file log options are all disabled.

    Enable SNAT by default in L3 agents
    
    If ext-gw-mode extension isn't supported by plugin, it won't
    return enable_snat param in router info. Agent will currently
    default to enable_snat = false, which changes from expected
    default behaviour prior to ext-gw-mode introduction.
    
    This patch changes L3 agent to enable SNAT by default if plugin
    doesn't support ext-gw-mode extension.

    Fixes Windows setup dependency bug
    
    Fixes bug: #1212385
    
    The neutron project includes a setup hook that allows to dinamically
    include setup dependencies.
    
    Due to recent changes in the pbr project, the hook raises an exception
    on Windows, which ends the setup process.
    
    This fix solves the issue by adapting the hook to the recent pbr changes.

    Unify exception thrown in l3-agent-scheduler fails
    
    Since you can only attach a single l3 agent to a router, when you try
    to add another l3 agent to a router that already have one, the l3
    agent scheduler raises an exception.
    
    This fix removes the discrimination by id: either it is the same agent
    or another one, the router can not be hosted and the same exception is
    raised.

    Mock os.makdirs to avoid directory creation in unit tests
    
    The directory 'dhcp' under neutron state path should not be
    created during unit tests. This patch mocks up calls to
    os.makedirs and ensures that methods that rely on it, like
    _populate_network_cache, are mocked as well.

    Refactor configuring of floating ips on a router.
    
    This approach to configuring floating ips is stateless and idempotent.
    This allows it to handle corner cases, such as reusing a floating ip
    address with a different floating ip id in a way that is easier to
    understand.
    
    The concept is to wipe the floating ips clean and rebuild them each
    time with the following optimizations.  To avoid bad performance in
    manipulating iptables, it is called in the context of a call to
    defer_apply_on.  To avoid a disruption in network flow a set
    difference is use to determine the set of addresses that no longer
    belong on the inteface rather than removing them all blindly.

    Remove DHCP lease logic
    
    Previously neutron was keeping track of dhcp lease time in order
    to ensure it didn't hand out an ip address that was already leased.
    This patch removes that logic and instead leverages the dhcp_release
    utility. This allows us to reuse ip addresses immediately after a port
    is deleted. This patch also bumps the lease time to 24 hours instead
    of 2 minutes with reduces the amount of dhcp traffic.
    
    DocImpact
    
    There is a DocImpact for this bug related to the upgrade path. One should
    first upgrade their dhcp-agents. Then wait till the dhcp_lease time has
    expired. Lastly, update neutron-server in order to avoid the case where
    an instance is deleted and the dnsmasq process has not released the lease

    Fix some NVP tests do not do cleanup of nvp ports
    
    Some of the NVP test do not execute self.addCleanup(self.fc.reset_all)
    from setUp() as NiciraPluginV2TestCase is not the first mixin.
    This casuses left over ports to still exist between different testcases.
    This patch only fixes this issue for TestNiciraPortsV2 and
    NiciraPortSecurityTestCaseas, some of the other tests require the setUp()
    for the first mixin to be called for their tests to work.
    
    Note: this is why the tests for the Remove DHCP lease logic are failing.

    This will enable the Cisco Nexus 1000V to integrate with the Cisco plugin
    and be used to drive the realization of Neutron constructs.
    Network profile and Policy profile are introduced as extended neutron
    resources, while n1kv:profile_id is introduced as an extended attribute
    for network and port objects. Necessary changes to the Cisco plugin are
    made to accomodate Nexus 1000V as a configurable vswitch plugin.

    Make SubnetMismatchForPort extend BadRequest rather than Conflict
    
    Nova is trying to do a better job of mapping Neutron exceptions and
    change I4c087684ef77988e5f463d7f2f50fc2a04f37db0 is trying to map 409 to
    the proper nova exception. In looking at what raises a 409 exception in
    Neutron, the SubnetMismatchForPort exception seemed like a candidate for
    changing from Conflict (409) to BadRequest (400) to ease that mapping.
    
    Note that the only thing currently using this exception is the L3 router
    extension when removing a router interface and the 400 response code is
    already listed in the API docs as a possible response code:
    
    http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-network/2.0/content/router_remove_interface.html
    
    Also note that it's generally OK to change APIs for a more accurate
    response code:

    Externalize error messages in the API
    
    This patch does more internationalization for the REST API error
    messages that don't currently have it to take advantage of the new
    support added by bp user-locale-api to show error messages in the locale
    requested by the user through the Accept-Language HTTP header.
    
    Partially implements bp user-locale-api

    Enable localizable REST API responses via the Accept-Language header
    
    Add support for doing language resolution for a request, based on the
    Accept-Language HTTP header. Using the lazy gettext functionality, from
    oslo gettextutils, it is possible to use the resolved language to
    translate exception messages to the user requested language and
    return that translation from the API.
    
    Partially implements bp user-locale-api.

    Make DbPlugin accept status in create_network().
    
    This commit makes NeutronDbPluginV2 get network status from input at
    create_network() to allow other plugins to set network status while
    creating DB entry.
    
    Now plugins can create network with any status in a single DB commit.
    (e.g. Set network status to 'DOWN' when admin_state_up is False.)
    
    This commit also changes NeutronDbPluginV2TestCase() to make default
    network status configurable in each plugin test case.

    Remove status* fields from HealthMonitor model
    
    Status and status_description fields of HealthMonitor
    model are never changed during lifetime of the object
    and doesn't represent the status of it's pysical
    implementation. Instead, status and status_description
    of PoolMonitorAssociation is used. Another reason for
    removing those fields is that HealthMonitor acts as
    template which is instantiated on device. Status field
    for template makes no sense.

    Make NEC Plugin keep error resources
    
    NEC Plugin used to ignore OFC errors while deleting resources from OFC,
    and it could leave some unused resources on OFC. If OFC generates id
    which is in remained resources when creating new resource, it will fail.
    
    This commit makes NEC Plugin keep logical resource when it failed to
    delete resource from OFC not to leave orphan resource on OFC, and raise
    exception to tell the user that the resouce status is Error.
    
    NOTE: The user can retry deletion. If the resouce was successfully
    deleted from OFC in retries, the logical resource will be deleted.

    Update to latest oslo rootwrap
    
    Update Neutron rootwrap to the latest from oslo-incubator. This allows
    to get rid of the DnsMasqFilter (which was already replaced by
    EnvFilter) in preparation for the havana release, as well as get a few
    bugfixes.
    
    All the changes are coming directly from the Oslo "rootwrap" module
    sync.

    defer firewall updates to iptables data structures
    
    One of two patches that fixes bug #1194438.
    
    In the iptables firewall driver, each port method (update_port_filter,
    prepare_port_filter, remove_port_filter) makes O(N) calls, where
    N=len(firewall.ports), to IptablesManager methods that update dozens
    of data structures. When the firewall methods are called in sequence,
    e.g., by SecurityGroupAgentRpcMixin, the calls to IptablesManager's
    methods start to add up.
    
    This patch changes IptablesFirewallDriver to defer and coalesce calls
    to IptablesManager. Now a sequence of M port method calls results in
    O(N) calls to IptablesManager methods instead of O(N*M) as before.

    Fix creation of trusted queues for the NVP plugin.
    
    Currently if an admin tries to create a trusted queue, Neutron will
    fail with MissingDSCPForTrusted exception. However, the NVP semantic
    is exactly the opposite, namely the DSCP field must be specified for
    untrusted queues and omitted trusted ones.
    
    Fixes bug #1204256

    refactor port binding codes
    
    Bug #1195047
    
    This patch:
    1. removes the iteration in get_ports to call extend_dict_binding
    2. uses a unified way for plugins to do this kind of stuff
    
    ml2 will enhance the binding so that it can have different binding
    for port according to port's host.
    mlnx and bigswitch are also exceptions due to the dynamic binding info.

    Ensure that L3 managed port have status ACTIVE
    
    Some plugins may set the port status as DOWN when it is created. This was not
    updated when the port was actually up. This patch ensures that gateway and
    router ports that are created will be set as ACTIVE when they are actually
    up and running.
    
    Ports that are attached to additional bridges in the OVS will only update the
    port status as ACTIVE. There will be no tags set on the specific ports as this
    will break the existing functionality.

    Fix DHCP agent to work with latest dnsmasq
    
    The latest dnsmasq no longer accepts hostnames which begin with a number. This
    affects Fedora 19 right now, and will mean Fedora 19 will not work with Neutron
    DHCP. dnsmasq should work with hostnames beginning with a number (RFC 1123 says
    this is valid), but until this is fixed, many users will be left unable to use
    Fedora 19 with Neutron.
    
    This patch adds a "host-" prefix to each hostname entry generated by the DHCP
    agent. This fixes the issue in Neutron.

    LBaaS: add delete_health_monitor() to driver API
    
    Currently there is create_health_monitor() in the driver API so
    a driver may create an object on device but there is no delete_health_monitor()
    and monitor objects will remain on device forever.
    Driver should at least call plugin to delete a db object.

    GRE tunnels should include local_ip.
    
    This addresses the issue of having one or more multi-homed host.
    
    Because you may only specify one local IP for a quantum agent, and
    other hosts could be routed across different subnets (even for small
    installations, for various reasons), it's important to also specify
    the used local_ip when setting up the GRE tunnels. As long as the
    address is routable on both ends, this will work. If the local_ip is
    not specified, then traffic will mysteriously be dropped on one end
    where the IP does not match the expected IP in the GRE tunnel.

    nvp plugin rxtx_factor readonly update port
    
    The following change done in nova 7de916 started passing in the
    rxtx_factor on update port rather than just on create_port which
    is what we only originally supported. Therefore currently when
    booting a vm and specifying --nic port-id it will fail to boot with:
    Cannot update read-only attribute rxtx_factor. This patch is a work
    around to allow the rxtx_factor value to be passed in on update port even
    though we ignore the value. Later we'll implement updating rxtx_factor on
    ports but this is a good work around for now.

    Fix argument name mismatch in L3-RPC sync_routers
    
    In sync_routers L3-RPC method l3-agent sends router_ids but the
    server side expected router_id. This commit fixes the server side
    to accept router_ids, and drops "fullsync" arg from the agent side
    (fullsync is not used anywhere and it does not affect RPC signature).
    This change allows l3-agent to sync only the specified routers
    instead of all routers.
    
    Fixes bug #1201553
    
    As a result of the above change, auto_schedule_routers() and
    list_active_sync_routers_on_active_l3_agent() in L3 scheduler
    needs to handle a list of router IDs. This commit changes L3 scheduler
    to accept a list of router IDs in the above two methods.
    
    Also fixes the argument order of fullsync and router_ids in get_routers
    in L3PluginApi. L3-agent main code expects router_ids as the second arg.

    Improve packet-filter test coverage in NEC Plugin
    
    blueprint nec-plugin-test-coverage
    
    This commit adds unit tests for packet-filter in NEC Plugin.
    
    This commit refactors packet-filter in NEC Plugin.
    - Put packet-filter classes and methods into nec/packet_filter.py (a) and
      nec/db/packetfilter.py (b), NEC Plugin specific codes are in (a)
    - Change stateless methods to class methods in extenstions/packetfilter.py
    - Add 'convert_to' option to the attribute map of packet-filter to convert
      some string parameter to int at the api layer
    
    Also, this commit includes the following changes in packet-filter.
    - Fix attribute map of packet-filter; set in_port to allow_put=False
    - Add new methods to update attribute map properly
    - Make packet-filters ignore status of associated resource (network)

    Improve l3-agent performance and prevent races in it.
    
    Fixes bug 1194026
    Fixes bug 1200749
    
    Introduce a looping call for performing synchronization with
    neutron server.
    The sync will be performed only if router changes are notified
    via rpc. Only affected routers will be synchronized.
    
    Changes will be implemented by the l3 agent spawning a
    distinct greenthread for each router - iptables will
    be executed only once using iptables_manager.defer_apply_on.
    
    This patch will prevent the occurence of the following issues:
    - Out-of-order rpc message processing
    - Long processing time for router changes due to serial execution
    - Occasional and expected RPC blocks for long periods
    - Unnecessary processing of multiple requests

    These errors seem to be linked to the NEC plugin and http connections
    not being stubbed out correctly. This patch ensures do_request is
    stubbed out prior to the tests execution; this should be enough
    to prevent timeouts from occurring again. Stubbing out the call has
    no effect on the coverage of the agent scheduler tests for the NEC
    plugin.

    Prevent possible server list damage in BigSwitch plugin
    
    The old failover logic for the BigSwitch plugin modified a
    list of controllers as it tested them. If the code for one
    thread unexpectedly raised an exception or died, the global
    server list could lose a server permanently.
    This patch addresses that by flagging servers as failed instead
    so the global server list is never modified.

    Modify the OVS agent to support multiple tunnel_types concurrently.
    
    This change modifies the "tunnel_type" configuration option to be a ListOpt
    instead of a StrOpt. This is intended to allow the agent to work in an ML2
    environment where multiple, disparate "tunnel_types" are supported at the
    same time. For now, the agent will enforce a single "tunnel_type".

    Add support for the extra route extension in the NVP plugin.
    
    The underlying feature is available in NVP 3.2, which introduces a
    new type of router. Therefore, create_lrouter needs to be made
    version 'aware'.
    
    This led to a number of fixes in the nvplib, especially around how
    version is retrieved and how version-dependent methods are called.

    Refactor unit tests for NEC Plugin
    
    blueprint nec-plugin-test-coverage
    
    This commit refactors the base class of unit tests for NEC Plugin to
    make writing new tests easier.
    
    Add fake OFC Manager and change unit tests which use OFC Manager mock
    to using this fake.  With this fake, we don't need to set return_value
    and side_effect to the mock instance of OFC Manager in each test case.
    This fake keeps all resources on OFC, and returns existence of
    resources properly.  This fake is attached to OFC Manager mock instance
    by setting all side_effects.  We can also set it to raise an exception.
    
    Make NEC Plugin configurable in each test case.  Now we can configure
    NEC Plugin by setting string in class value "_nec_ini" which will be
    written into a temporal file and loaded by NEC plugin.
    
    Move setup for callbacks into NecPluginV2TestCase() so that other unit
    tests can use callbacks.

    unnecessary exception handling and failover logic in calls

    Fix issue with pip installing oslo.config-1.2.0
    
    Fixes bug #1194807
    
    Firstly, we update the oslo.config dep to 1.2.0a3 because of the issue
    with namespace packages (bug #1194742).
    
    But the main issue here is that if you currently do:
    
      $> pip install -r quantum/requirements.txt
    
    then you end up with the oslo.config 1.1.1 code installed. This is
    because oslo.config>=1.1.0 gets pulled in as a transitive dep and pip
    gets confused. You can reproduce with e.g.
    
      $> pip install \
           http://.../oslo.config-1.2.0a3.tar.gz#egg=oslo.config-1.2.0a3 \
           python-keystoneclient
      $> pip freeze | grep oslo.config
      oslo.config-1.2.0a3
      $> python -c 'from oslo.config.cfg import DeprecatedOpt'
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
      ImportError: cannot import name DeprecatedOpt
    
    This is because of a bug with pip where it sees oslo.config-1.2.0a3 and
    oslo.config as two unrelated things. It should strip the version part of
    the egg= fragment before using it as a package name, but it doesn't.
    
    However, we can simply use the -f/--find-links pip option in our
    requirements.txt to add the tarball URL to the list of URLs considered
    and also add the oslo.config>=1.2.0a3 dependency:
    
      $> pip install \
           -f http://.../oslo.config-1.2.0a3.tar.gz#egg=oslo.config-1.2.0a3 \
           'oslo.config>=1.2.0a3' \
           python-keystoneclient
      $> pip freeze | grep oslo.config
      oslo.config-1.2.0a3
      $> python -c 'from oslo.config.cfg import DeprecatedOpt'
    
    This is actually exactly the semantics we want and we go to great
    lengths in pbr to get these semantics while using a single tarball URL.
    The only downside to this --find-links strategy is that we gain an extra
    line in our requirements.txt ... but it does work around the pip bug.

    This line of code serialized the python structure for the device and throws it

    found that it takes a very large amount of space in the log file causing them
    to grow very quickly and fill our log disk.  This change extracts the device
    name (e.g.  "tapcdc07af9-8a") and uses that in the log message.

    Initial Modular L2 Mechanism Driver implementation.
    
    Define the Mechanism Driver interface for create/update/delete
    operations on networks and ports. For each of these event, the
    Mechanism Driver provides one method that is called within the
    database transaction of the ml2 plugin method, and one that is called
    after the transaction is completed.
    
    Support for mechanism drivers is still a work-in-progress, and the
    interface is subject to change in future versions before the release
    of Havana. However this initial version should be sufficient to enable
    others to start defining their own mechanism drivers.

    Improve DHCP agent performance
    
    Previously when starting the dhcp agent the sync_state() process would
    be extremely expensive as it would query quantum server for each network.
    In order to improve performance a get_active_networks_info() was added
    so this information could be retrieved in one query rather than doing a
    query for each active network.
    
    The second part of this patch optimizes the logic to avoid calling
    get_dhcp_port(). Previously, this method was called once for each network
    which makes a call to get_subnets() and get_ports() unnecessarily as
    the dhcp agent can determine itself if it needs to update a port or create a
    port for dhcp.
    
    This patch also threads the inital sync process and maintains backwards
    compatibility with the previous rpc api.
    
    There was also a trivial change to the nvp_plugin where filters are assumed to
    be a dict.

    Allow router route update in XML.
    
    Fixes: bug 1198188
    
    Router updates of routes in XML format fails.
    This patch fixes that problem. It also executes
    unit tests for XML-based requests to update
    router routes.

    Preserve packet:byte counts in iptables_manager.
    
    Ported the nova iptables manager code to neutron, so that we
    use iptables-save/restore with the -c flag to save/restore
    the chains and rules with their packet:byte counts.  All other
    changes were ported as well to keep the code as similar as
    possible between the two, although they will be different as
    I had to fix other bugs found during testing.
    
    Updated tests accordingly to account for new calls and
    input/output changes in formatting.
    
    Changed iptables_firewall code to add iptables rules in the same
    order that iptables-save will print them: source/dest, protocol,
    sport, dport, target; else iptables_manager won't be able
    to find them to preserve their [packet:byte] counts.
    Tweaked other rules accordingly as necessary.
    
    Fixed a bug introduced in an earlier version of this patch where
    _modify_rules() sometimes wouldn't match an existing rule correctly
    if not top=true.
    
    Fixes bug 1125393

    Import Oslo's common rootwrap to Neutron
    
    Use the common oslo-incubator rootwrap rather than maintain a
    specific fork within Neutron.
    
    - Migrated DnsmasqFilter use in dhcp.filters to the new EnvFilter
    - Changed environment passing in ip_lib's netns.execute so that
      it can be properly matched using IpNetNsExecFilter + EnvFilter.
      It now calls "ip netns exec ns env A=B C=D command" instead of
      "A=B C=D ip netns exec ns command". Adjusted tests accordingly.
    
    All the other changes are coming directly from the Oslo "rootwrap"
    module sync.
    
    Notes:
    - Neutron locates its rootwrap.conf in etc/ rather than in etc/neutron
    - Neutron maintains a specific bin/quantum-rootwrap-xen-dom0 which
      requires additional config in rootwrap.conf
    
    Both behaviors were preserved in this commit, but this may need to be
    addressed in the future to simplify future oslo-rootwrap updates.

    Limit min<=max port check to TCP/UDP in secgroup rule
    
    icmp_type and icmp_code are mapped to port_min_range and port_max_range
    respectively. For ICMP there is no constraint between type and code.
    Thus port range min<=max check should be enforced only for TCP and UDP.
    
    Also makes sure that ICMP type/code are 0 to 255 (both inclusive).
    Previously a value with 0 to 65535 were accepted for ICMP type/code.

    Do not mask NotImplementedError exceptions
    
    With this patch we  avoid masking NotImplementedError(s).
    Previously, a catch-all clause returned 500, and it makes
    sense to distinguish between genuine 500 errors (i.e. a bug),
    versus 501 ones.
    
    This opens up the issue of keeping the server behavior
    consistent from one release to another, but one might argue
    that this was bad design decision in the first place.

    This patch leverages the same approach as bug 1174111 for avoiding

    make_network_dict, _extend_network_dict_l3 are refactored accordingly.
    
    Also, this patch sligthly alters the logic of process_l3_network_create
    and process_l3_network_update as these methods assumed
    _extend_network_dict_l3 was always executed before retuerning.
    
    Finally, calls to get_network and get_networks in plugins which only
    extended the response with l3 attributes have been completely removed.

    Remove duplicate _check_provider_update from plugins
    
    This patch removes the duplicated method _check_provider_update
    and adds a check for it in the NVP plugin that was missing so that an error
    is raised if someone tries to update a provider network.

    Update code to properly use dict returned from get_gateway.
    
    Calling get_gateway was a late addition to my code to add a default
    route in the DHCP namespace.  The code did not properly handle the
    dict returned from that method.  This changes it to properly extract
    the 'gateway' attribute from the dict.

    Support a timeout argument when instantiating a bigswitch plugin
    
    The timeout argument overwrites the timeout value set in the config file.
    The change permits any standalone script to interact with the bigswitch controller
    through the quantum plugin with customized timeout value without changing the plugin
    behavior.

    faster quantum-openvswitch-agent periodic reports
    
    One of two patches that fixes bug #1194438.
    
    Instead of spawning ovs-vsctl for every port on br-int, we just dump the
    required columns from the Interfaces table and grab the rows that we need. This
    is a big win because the time it takes for ovs-vsctl to connect to the
    openvswitch controller is orders of magnitude greater than the time it takes to
    parse the rows. In practice, instead of taking roughly 1s per interface, the
    agent's periodic task only takes 1s in total.

    Use 0.0.0.0/0 host route as router option
    
    There is a currently a hacky way to get the dhcp-agent to hand out a
    gateway route using a host route on the subnet. If you pass a route
    that has 0.0.0.0/0 as its destination, dnsmasq will pass it as a static
    route. Unfortunately it will also pass the router option if the subnet
    has a gateway set. This is inconsistent and precludes users from options
    that are available in nova-network like using an external gateway.
    
    This patch fixes things by allowing a 0.0.0.0/0 host route to override
    the router setting passed by dnsmasq. This prevents the situation
    where dnsmasq hands out two default routes.

    This table is then used to allow users to override

    This allows quantum to control an environment with multiple

    Do not raise NEW exceptions
    
    Raising NEW exception is bad practice, because we lose TraceBack.
    So all places like:
    
    except SomeException as e:
        raise e
    
    should be replaced by
    
    except SomeException:
        raise
    
    If we are doing some other actions before reraising we should
    store information about exception then do all actions and then
    reraise it. This is caused by eventlet bug. It lost information
    about exception if it switch threads.

    Adds support for router rules to Big Switch plugin
    
    Implements: blueprint bsn-router-rules
    
    Adds bigswitch plugin extension which adds 'rules' dictionary to router objects.
    Adds validation code and database components to store router rules
    Adds configuration option to plugin to set default router rules and max router rules
    Adds unit tests to test all router rule functionality
    Adds database migration for router rules tables
    
    The Big Switch controller's Virtual Router implementation supports "routing rules"
    which are of the form:
    <source, destination, next-hop, action>
    This extension aims to expose this abstraction via the Big Switch Quantum plugin.
    
    These rules are applied at the router level, allowing tenants to control
    communication between networks at a high level without requiring security policies.
    (e.g. prevent servers in a publicly accessible subnet from communicating with
    database servers).

    replace use of dhcp_lease_time with dhcp_lease_duration
    
    Having 2 separate dhcp lease period flags (dhcp_lease_duration
    used by the quantum db plugin, and dhcp_lease_time used by the
    dnsmasq dhcp agent) means that you could potentially have different
    lease periods being set, and used by different parts of the codebase.
    
    It seems to me there is no real need to have 2 separate flags, so this
    commit basically replaces references to dhcp_lease_time (which is used
    by the dnsmasq dhcpagent) with dhcp_lease_duration. This way, there
    is only one flag to set, and both the quantum db plugin and dnsmasq
    dhcp agent will use the same lease period.

    Nicira plugin: Do not expect a minimum number of SNAT rules
    
    Bug 1192392
    
    The code was assuming a SNAT rule for each subnet was always present
    when clearing a gateway. If the SNAT rule was removed for some other
    reason from the NVP backend, this would have led to the failure of
    the whole operation; however, a failure won't have been necessary
    in this case, as the final effect of the operation is to remove
    the rules anyway.
    
    Also, this patch ensures a quantum router is put in ERROR state if
    it is not found on the NVP backend.

    Adds default route to DHCP namespace for upstream name resolution.
    
    Any time the DHCP server is updated this code will maintain a default
    route in the DHCP namespace using the gateway_ip attribute of the
    first DHCP-enabled IPV4 subnet in the list of subnets where gateway_ip
    is not None.  This strategy uses the same gateway ip that the DHCP
    server hands to the VMs on the network.

    Reference default_servicetype group in lowercase
    
    Now that we require oslo-config-1.2.0, we can start referencing group
    names as lowercase. Let's start with the default_servicetype group.
    
    We do this simply by changing the case of the group name passed to
    register_opt():
    
      -cfg.CONF.register_opts(..., 'DEFAULT_SERVICETYPE')
      +cfg.CONF.register_opts(..., 'default_servicetype')
    
    and this means that all options in the group now need to be referenced
    using the lowercase group name i.e.
    
      -svc_defs = cfg.CONF.DEFAULT_SERVICETYPE.service_definition
      +svc_defs = cfg.CONF.default_servicetype.service_definition
    
    Note however, users can still use the uppercase section name for
    backwards compatibility.
    
    When we last attempted to do this, oslo.config-1.2.0 wasn't actually
    being installed correctly so add a unit test which verifies that both
    uppercase and lowercase section names work.

    Allow use of lowercase section names in conf files
    
    Fixes bug #1189889
    
    oslo.config-1.2.0 normalizes section names in config files to lowercase.
    This means that simply by upgrading to oslo.config-1.2.0, users will now
    be able to do e.g.
    
      [default_servicetype]
      description = ...
      service_definition = ...
    
    Change the default config files to make it clear we recommend the use of
    lowercase section names.
    
    Note, the use of an alpha tarball of oslo.config requires pbr>=0.5.15
    but we already require >=0.5.16.

    Ensure to remove auto delete ports from OFC in NEC plugin
    
    When deleting a network, dhcp ports are removed automatically
    in db_plugin. This causes a failure network deletion since the
    corresponding port exists on OFC and the network on OFC cannot
    be deleted unless a subnet on the network is deleted explicitly.
    This commit gets auto-delete ports and delete the corresponding
    ports on the controller before deleting the network.

    Add support for VXLAN to the Open vSwitch plugin.
    
    This commit adds support for utilizing the VXLAN tunneling protocol in versions
    of Open vSwitch >= 1.10. This is configurable and will default to GRE if not
    configured. As part of this commit, it is possible to configure the UDP port
    VXLAN will utilize as well. VXLAN and GRE cannot be configured at the same
    time with this patch. 2 new configuration file options are added to the AGENT
    section of the config to support this: 'tunnel_type' and 'vxlan_udp_port'.
    In addition, the agent no longer makes use of enable_tunneling, as this can
    be determined if tunnel_type is set.
    
    Note: The VXLAN functionality utilized here is what is implemented in Open
    vSwitch itself, and is different than the VXLAN functionality in the
    upstream Linux kernel. The code validates both the userspace and kernel
    pieces of OVS to verify if VXLAN functionality can be supported on the
    running system
    
    Implements blueprint ovs-vxlan-lisp-tunnel

    The lockfile module has a new convenience API which sets the lockfile prefix.
    Using this API, the prefix is not required everytime synchronized is used.

    Change lazy='dynamic' to 'joined' in models_v2
    
    Previously several models were defined with lazy='dynamic'. This would
    then cause Ports.fixed_ips (or w/e was specified as dynamic) to be defined
    as a AppenderQuery object and when accessed would query for the result.
    Therefore in get_ports() for example, when fixed_ips was accessed
    in _make_port_dict() we would be issuing an addition query to the database
    to lookup the fixed_ips information.
    
    This patch changes update_port/subnet() so that it keeps track of what
    changed so it does not have to query the db for values it should already
    know about.
    
    This patch also adds a unit test for update_subnet() adding host routes
    where there was missing code coverage.

    nicira plugin: load subnet once when adding router interface

    Also, the port is now loaded from the database only if the
    corresponding NVP logical port is found.

    Add support for protocol numbers
    
    This patch adds support for passing in protocol numbers into the API.
    For example, 1 instead of ICMP. This allows all protocols besides
    just TCP/UDP/ICMP to be used. This patch includes changes to support
    this for the NVP Plugin. Existing plugins using securitygroups_rpc_base
    and OVSHybridIptablesFirewallDriver require no change to leverage this.

    Expose most common QueuePoll parameters from SQLAlchemy
    
    Fixes bug 1160442
    
    The defualt parameters are used unless otherwise configured. This
    is applicable for:
     - pool_size
     - max_overflow
     - pool_timeout
    
    By increasing the pool_size and the max_overflow and lowering the timeout
    the issue reported in the bug is resolved.
    
    NOTE: the configuration values enable the user to make use of the default
    QueuePool tuning values.

    Add rollback for Cisco plugin update_port failure
    
    Fixes bug 1174433
    
    This fix adds a rollback of the OVS plugin update_port operation
    following a failure to update the port in the Cisco Nexus sub-plugin.
    
    Also, this fix removes an unneccessary call to the Nexus sub-plugin's
    update_network method within the Cisco plugin model layer's
    update_network method (as well as the associated argument setup).
    The Nexus sub-plugin's update_network is a no-op, so there's no
    need to call it.

    Sphinx-ify QuantumPluginBaseV2 docstrings
    
    The quantum.quantum_plugin_base_v2 module had some good docstrings,
    but there was no corresponding sphinx code that would generate
    docs from them. There were also some syntax issues with the
    sphinx markup in the docstrings.
    
    This change adds sphinx directives so these docs will be auto-
    generated. It also modifies the docstrings in the QuantumPluginBaseV2
    methods so they are parsed by the Sphinx documentation generator
    without any errors.
    
    If this patch is accepted, a "Plugin API" link to these docs
    will appear at
    
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/quantum/

    Initial Modular L2 plugin implementation.
    
    The Modular L2 Plugin uses drivers to support separately extensible
    sets of network types and of mechanisms for accessing networks of
    those types. This is an initial implementation that has been tested
    with the openvswitch and linuxbridge agents, and should also work with
    the hyperv agent. See quantum/plugins/ml2/README for details.

    Configurable external gateway modes
    
    Blueprint l3-ext-gw-modes
    
    This patch introduces an API extension for enabling or disabling
    source/destination NAT on the router gateway interface, and implements
    support for this extension in the l3 agent, which has also been
    refactored in order to ensure SNAT rules are applied (or removed)
    in a single place in the process_router routine.
    The patch therefore enables the extension on all plugins which
    leverage this agent.
    In this patch the validate_boolean function is re-introduced, as it
    used for validating a field of the external_gateway_info dict.
    The resource extension process is also slightly changed so that an
    API extension can specify which extension should be processed before
    its attributes can be processed. This is needed to ensure the
    proper validator for external_gateway_info is installed.

    Perform a sync with oslo-incubator.
    
    This oslo-incubator sync pulls in a new log.py which will make quantum's
    default log output format the same as nova, glance and cinder (once
    cinder's corresponding oslo sync merges). This common log format
    simplifies log indexing as part of CI and makes lives easier for
    deployers.
    
    This sync does add a requirement on six as jsonutils depends on it. It
    updates install_venv_common.py to be python26 compatible. It also brings
    in a bunch of recent python3 compatibility that was added to oslo.

    Require oslo.config 1.2.0a2
    
    Fixes bug #1182662
    
    Commit 362bd7f switched us from using 'QUOTA' as a config file section
    name to using 'quota'.
    
    This broke backwards compatibility support for 'QUOTA' because the
    version of oslo.config that has that compat support had not yet been
    released. The gory details are summarized here:

    Nicira plugin: List ports on network gateways
    
    Bug 1183277
    
    This patch adds a read-only attribute to the network gateway API
    extension. This attribute will return the list of ports connected to
    a gateway, including their segmentation types and ids.
    This patch now adds joined load for a gateway's connections, thus
    avoiding extra queries to the db.

    Previous code simply removed IP allocation for these ports which

    IP addresses can be reused by other ports.

    Reference QUOTA OptGoup names in lowercase
    
    To have consistent option group name format across projects,
    oslo.config now normalizes all non lowercase group names to lowercase
    when loading conf files.
    Thus conf files are backwards compatible but option group references
    in the code must now use lowercase before we update oslo.config.
    
    This patch replaces all 'QUOTA' references to 'quota'

    Blueprint make-authz-orthogonal
    
    Patch #4 for this blueprint.
    With this change, if policies starting with 'extension' are still
    present in policy.json, a deprecation warning will be emitted, and
    the policy will be translated in the corresponding, new-style,
    policy(ies).

    fix reference to tenant id.
    
    Administrator can create resource, even if the tenant of resource is
    different from the one of authentication. For example, administrator
    can operate 'quantum net-create' command with different tenant
    between the authentication tenant(--os-tenant-name) and --tenant-id.
    
    In this case, quota cannot be restricted with the resource tenant,
    because it is restricted with --os-tenant-name.
    
    This patch fixes this problem.

    Fix linuxbridge RPC message format
    
    The linuxbridge, openvswitch, and hyperv plugins all use the same
    basic RPC interface between their plugins and L2 agents. But the
    attributes describing a virtual network passed from the plugin to the
    agent over this interface differed for historical reasons. The
    openvswitch and hyperv plugins each pass network_type,
    physical_network, and segmentation_id attributes, whereas the
    linuxbridge plugin previously passed vlan_id and physical_network
    attributes, using special vlan_id values to indicate flat or local
    network types.
    
    This patch changes the linuxbridge plugin to pass network_type and
    segmentation_id attributes instead of the vlan_id attribute, bringing
    its message formats into sync with the other plugins. RPC
    compatibility is required for blueprint modular-l2 so that the ml2
    plugin can work with all three existing types of L2 agent. This RPC
    message format change is also required for blueprint
    vxlan-linuxbridge.
    
    Unlike the vxlan-linuxbridge patch on which it is based (see
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/26516/), this patch does not bump the
    linuxbridge RPC version number, as the ml2 plugin will require all
    three L2 agents to use the same RPC version. Instead, the updated
    linuxbridge agent maintains compatibility with old linuxbridge plugins
    by accepting either the old or new attributes. There is also a
    configuration option, currently turned on by default, to enable the
    updated linuxbridge plugin to pass the vlan_id attribute expected by
    old linuxbridge agents along with the new attributes. These message
    format compatibility mechanisms are intended to aid during upgrades,
    and can eventually be removed.

    Fix Cisco Nexus plugin failures for vlan IDs 1006-4094
    
    Fixes bug 1174593
    
    VLAN IDs in the range 1006-4094 are considered to be in the extended
    range by the Cisco Nexus 3K switch. As such, the 3K rejects any
    state change configuration commands for VLANs in this range, including
    "state active" and "no shutdown". The errors returned by the 3K for
    these commands can be ignored, since the default states for these commands
    are acceptable for the 3K.
    
    For the 5K and 7K versions of the Nexus switch, on the other hand, the
    "state active" and "no shutdown" commands are required for proper VLAN
    configuration, regardless of VLAN ID.
    
    This fix splits the configuration commands which are used to create a
    VLAN on the Nexus switch into three separate configurations:
      - VLAN creation
      - state active
      - no shutdown
    For the "state active" and "no shutdown" configurations, the Cisco Nexus
    plugin will tolerate (ignore) errors involving invalid setting of state
    for VLANs in the extended VLAN range. These specific errors can be
    identified by looking for the appearance of certain signature strings
    in the associated exception's message string, i.e. "Can't modify
    state for extended" or "Command is allowed on VLAN".
    
    This approach will yield a very small hit in performance, but the solution
    is much less error prone than requiring customers to configure the
    Cisco plugin for 3K vs. 5K vs. 7K, or perhaps even specific software
    versions of the 3K, in order to inform the Cisco plugin whether
    VLAN state configuration commands should be used or not.

    Remove calls to policy.check from plugin logic
    
    Blueprint make-authz-orthogonal
    
    This patch implements part #3 of this blueprint, according to its
    specification.
    It does so by allowing the view generator in the API layer to strip
    off fields which do not satify authorization policies.
    Also, some checks in unit tests for plugins relied on the
    capability of the plugin to invoke directly the policy engine.
    This checks have been removed and replaced by equivalent unit tests.
    Finally, this patch required changes to most test cases for API
    extensions in order to ensure the resource attribute map was
    updated with the extension's attributes

    Allow ports to be created on networks that do not exist in NVP
    
    If a network exists in the quantum database but not in NVP we should allow
    someone to create a port on this network and set the status to ERROR. The
    reason for this is if one deletes a network from NVP and when the dhcp agent
    goes to create it's dhcp port on this network an error will be raised to the
    agent and it will enter a constant state of resyncing.
    
    This patch also adds a unit test for update_port() for the same situation.

    Do not require sudo/rootwrap to check for dnsmasq version
    
    The dnsmasq version check does not need root privileges
    to run as with low privs it works just fine. As a side
    effect, the use of the rootwrapper was causing unit tests
    to hung because the execute call in check_version was not
    being stubbed out. Weirdly enough this wasn't caught in
    a previous Gerrit run; there must be a passwordless sudo
    lurking around somewhere in the Gerrit infrastructure.

    root_helper setting from the [DEFAULT] section of /etc/quantum/dhcp_agent.ini
    was being used.

    Log a warning if dnsmasq version is below the minimum required
    
    It has been noted that older versions of dnsmasq may have unexpected
    behavior, so this patch introduces a check on dnsmasq version; if
    the minimum version is not met, a warning is logged. This is less
    invasive than raising an Exception and abort the dhcp agent, even
    though this also seems like a perfectly acceptable behavior.

    Import recent rootwrap features in local rootwrap
    
    Import features developed in oslo-rootwrap during the Grizzly cycle (and
    recently in havana) into quantum-rootwrap. This is the first step toward
    using the common oslo-rootwrap into Quantum: the goal being to make both
    implementations converge, we should avoid making local changes (and push
    any required change into oslo-rootwrap instead from now on).
    
    New features include:
    - Optional logging (use_syslog)
    - Searching for executables in a specified binary path (exec_dirs)
    - New path-based PathFilter
    
    Those features required a refactoring in the way executables are matched
    and in configuration loading.
    
    Implements bp quantum-rootwrap-new-features

    If one deletes NAT rules directly from NVP and not through quantum,

    Fetch routers ports for metadata access from DB
    
    Bug 1176963
    
    There is no need to retrieve the ports from the NVP backend, so
    a DB query will be enough.

    update-port error if port does not exist in nvp
    
    Previously the NVP plugin would query NVP for the quantum port id that was
    stored in the port as a tag in NVP. Later, a look up table was added in order
    to directly look up the ID without having to go to NVP. The problem that can
    arise is that if a port was created in folsom before this lookup table was
    added and then deleted from NVP directly an error will be raised when calling
    update_port(). This patch fixes this potential problem.
    
    Fixes bug 1172006

    blueprint cisco-plugin-exception-handling
    
    Improvements to exception handling in the Cisco plugins. Changes
    include:
    
    - Added mapping of Cisco exceptions to HTTP codes
      (extension to FAULT_MAP).
    - Removed several unused Cisco exception definitions.
    - Added several new Cisco exceptions for fault conditions.
    - Added several rollbacks for various sequential operations, e.g.:
      * Create port: Nexus sub-plugin fails after OVS sub-plugin success
      * Create port: Nexus switch conig fails after adding binding to
                     Nexus binding database
      * Delete port: OVS sub-plugin fails after Nexus sub-plugin success
    - Delete Port: Reversed order of OVS/Nexus sub-plugin calls so that
      it is done in the reverse order as is done for create port.
    - Removed several empty except/raise blocks
    - Delete network: Removed call to Nexus sub-plugin delete_network,
      since that is a no-op.
    - Removed a block of unused code in model's create_network method.
    - Added several unit testcases, including patching of OVS, Cisco
      and Nexus config.
    - Remove CISCO_TEST configuration from cisco plugin
      config .ini file.

    Perform a joined query for ports and security group associations
    
    bug 1174111
    
    Instead of loading security group associations with a separate query
    each time a port is loaded from the database, perform the load operation
    with a join using a joined sqlalchemy relationship.
    Also, this patch removes the need for invoking the mixin method
    'extend_port_dict_security_group' from the plugin code.

    Fix usage of Query.all() and NoResultFound
    
    SQLAlchemy Query.all() method doesn't raise NoResultFound
    exception in case if no result is found but rather returns
    an empty list. So this pattern which is common for our code
    doesn't make sense and should be fixed:
    
        try:
            dns_qry = context.session.query(models_v2.DNSNameServer)
            return dns_qry.filter_by(subnet_id=subnet_id).all()
        except exc.NoResultFound:
            return []

     * The Open vSwitch agent needs to be deployed on domU but
       interact with a dom0 bridge.
     * Add a root wrapper and associated XenAPI plugin to allow the
       agent to execute networking commands against dom0 from domU.
     * Update ovs_lib mac address discovery to use ip_lib to
       ensure that discovery works even for bridges not local to
       the agent (i.e. dom0 bridges).  A bridge configured with
       a dom0 root wrapper will execute ip link on dom0.
     * Update ip_lib to use a root helper by default to ensure that
       the 'ip' command will execute on dom0.
     * Remove obselete rpm spec and installer for dom0 agent.
     * Credit where credit is due - the XenAPI plugin and its
       packaging were largely copied from nova.
     * Supports blueprint xenapi-ovs

    Avoid initialization of policy engine before extensions are loaded
    
    Bug 1174877
    
    For a particular NVP extension, a database entry was being populated
    in the plugin's __init__ method. The entry was added with an admin
    context. Grabbing the context caused the policy engine to load before
    all the extension were loaded, so rule on extended attribute
    were not being parsed correctly.
    This cause checks on external networks to fail always.

    Fix 'null' response on router-interface-remove operation
    
    To avoid a 'null' response body, the delete operation returns a response
    that is consistent with its add counterpart, i.e. we return the router
    id with details about the interface being affected by the operation, as
    well as the tenant id.
    
    A unit test is added to ensure that the right body is returned and minor
    adjustments have been made to the plugins affected by the change.
    
    Long-term, a delete operation should really return 204 w/o a body, but
    this requires some major rework of the WSGI handling within Quantum.
    This is an interim solution that deals with an 'ugly' response body,
    whilst keeping backward compatibility.

    Remove calls to policy.enforce from plugin and db logic
    
    Blueprint make-authz-orthogonal
    
    This patch implementes item #2 of the blueprint
    Remove calls to policy.enforce when the policy check can be performed
    safely at the API level, and modify policy.json to this aim.
    This patch does not address enforce calls in the agent scheduler
    extension, as that extension is currently not defined as a quantum.v2.api
    resource class.
    This patch also adds an API-level test case for the provider networks
    extension, which was missing in Quantum and was necessary to validate
    the API behaviour with the default policy settings.

    Use Query instances as iterables when possible
    
    A Query.all() call creates a list of a DB query results.
    We can actually use a Query instance as an iterable and
    thus avoid creation of a list if we just need to iterate
    over those values only once.

    Simplify NVP plugin configuration
    
    Fixes bug #1121605
    
    This patch replacest the nvp_controller_connection configuration option
    with a set of options more intutitive to user which also avoid
    repetitions in ini files.
    
    In order to simplify the configuration of the plugin, this patch also
    removes named clusters. As the plugin supports a single cluster at
    the moment, this can be simply specified in the [DEFAULT] configuration
    section.
    
    Also, this patch restrucures nvp_cluster.NvpCluster so that per-cluster
    configuration options are not store anymore multiple times.

    Make the 'admin' role configurable
    
    Bug 1158434
    
    This patch adds a new policy named 'context_is_admin' which defines
    an admin user as a collection of roles or else. The quantum context
    has been updated to check for this policy when setting the is_admin
    flag.
    This patch also adds a method for gathering 'admin' roles from policy
    rules as current logic requires the context to be always populate with
    the correct roles for admin rules, even when the context is implicitly
    generated with get_admin_context or context.elevated.
    Backward compatibility is ensuring by preserving the old behavior if
    the 'context_is_admin' policy is not found in policy.json

    Simplify delete_health_monitor() using cascades
    
    Currently delete_health_monitor() emulates behaviour of
    cascade deletion: when a HealthMonitor instance is deleted,
    all corresponding PoolMonitorAssociations are queried and
    deleted one by one. This can be done automatically by means
    of SQLAlchemy if we set proper cascade flags on the relationship
    between HealthMonitor and PoolMonitorAssociations models.

    Make "shared" filter more compatible with diff DBs
    
    For the type BOOLEAN, in sqlalchemy,
    it's mapped to BOOLEAN type if the backend database supports it,
    otherwise, it's mapped to one of the Integer types, like SMALLINT,
    and restrict the values to 1(True) and 0(False).
    
    query_filter = (... | model.shared))
    The above filter will generate a SQL where clause like:
    where ... OR xxx.shared
    
    This is not supported in databases which don't support BOOLEAN type.
    Change it as below to make it more compatible:
    query_filter = (... | model.shared == True))
    
    It will generate a SQL where clause as below:
    where ... OR xxx.shared = ?
    
    In Python, True == 1, so this change is compatible
    with both databases supporting BOOLEAN and those not supporting it.

    Parallelize quantum unit testing:
    
    This change switches run_tests.sh to use testr
    in parallel mode, instead of nosetests, in order
    to enable unit tests to run in parallel.
    
    By default, the number of parallel test processes
    is set to the number of cores on the test machine.
    
    A similar change was recently merged to nova:
      https://review.openstack.org/#/c/15078/
    
    Some tests required updating to remove inter-testcase
    dependencies.

    Use wrappers instead of direct calls to ip route.
    
     - extract the logic of ip route wrapper into a separate
       class to drop dependency on a specific network device
     - add route wrapper to IPWrapper class
     - use IPWrapper instead of direct calls to ip route in l3 agent
     - update tests

    Add RabbitMQ and QPID HA support flags to quantum.conf
    
    Since Quantum supports HA queues with RabbitMQ (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/13760/),
    quantum.conf should provide new flags for explain how to configure multiple RabbitMQ servers and enable HA.
    
    New flags :
    rabbit_hosts=$rabbit_host:$rabbit_port
    rabbit_ha_queues=false
    qpid_hosts = localhost:5672

    Scope: Unification of all the various plugin files for the Cisco plugin into a single file.
    
    Use Cases: Quantum with the Cisco plugin.
    
    Implementation Overview: All the config values contained in the various files in
    etc/quantum/plugins/cisco will be unified into a single file
    etc/quantum/plugins/cisco/cisco_plugin.ini. The plugins needs to be modified to
    read from a single file instead of multiple.
    Added quantum.openstack.common.cfg support.

commit 891a860d58e651812bb4aa978946159fac3b709a
Author: Aaron Rosen <arosen@nicira.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 15 14:45:42 2013 -0700

    Add metadata support for nvp plugin without namespaces
    
    If using a host that does not support namespaces the nvp plugin did not have
    a way to leverage metadata unless using enable_isolated_metadata which
    requires a subnet to not have a gateway. This patch changes the metadata
    configuration for the NVP plugin by adding a flag metadata which can be
    set to access_network (which was previously enable_metadata_access_network)
    or dhcp_host_route. When set to dhcp_host_route when the dhcp agent creates
    it's port a host_route is added towards the dhcp server's ip for the
    destination 169.254.169.254/32 only if the subnet has as gatway_ip.
    In order for a host to leverage metadata via dhcp_route_route it requires
    the host's dhcp client to support host routes (code 121).

    netns: ip netns exec <name> kill doesn't make sense
    
    It seems confusing netns with pidns.
    Although 'ip netns exec' doesn't make sense,
    'ip netns exec <netns> kill <pid>' itself success as expected.
    But as side effects, dentry of /proc/<pid>/ns/net becomes young,
    which increases the possibility to fail to delete netns. That's not good.

    Fix race condition in dhcp agent
    
    This patch fixes a race condition that can happen in the dhcp agent when
    a subnet is created and then a host route is then immediately added to that
    subnet following a subnet.update.end notification. The race condition occurs
    in refresh_dhcp_helper() where self.enable_dhcp_helper() gets called twice
    since the first call had not completed self.cache.put(network). This same race
    condition can also occur in the other events so lockutils.synchronized() is
    added to synchronize those code segments as well.

    Add bulking support for Cisco plugin
    
    For each bulk request, the Cisco plugin will handle the call,
    and, through the base class method, convert them into a series of
    non-bulking calls wrapped in a transaction (emulated bulking).
    
    Those non-bulking requests will all be forwarded to the Cisco
    model (VirtualPhysicalSwitchModelV2), which will either handle
    the request locally (as in create_port), or delegate the request
    to the OVS plugin (OVSQuantumPluginV2).
    
    As a result, the model should not receive any bulking calls.
    However, the model was set up to delegate any bulk calls to the
    OVS plugin (which would act like the existing code, in case we
    decide later to pass along any bulk calls). An alternative would
    be to raise an exception, if a bulk call was made to the model.
    
    Prior to this change, all bulking calls were forwarded from the
    Cisco plugin to the model plugin, which would would delegate
    (directly or indirectly) to the OVS plugin. The OVS plugin would
    turn the request into a transction of non-bulking calls.
    
    The effective difference proposed is that the create_port will now
    create the port in OVS and then create the network in the Nexus
    plugin.
    
    The Nexus plugin does not currently handle bulking so this commit
    is implementing emulated (versus native) bulking.
    
    This patch has been updated with latest from upstream (Havana).

    Tests in TestDhcpAgentEventHandler depend on dhcp_confs
    option that is defined in quantum.agent.linux.dhcp. We have
    to register the option in order to allow independent testing.

    Pin SQLAlchemy to 0.7.x
    
    0.7.10 has been released and is compatible with 0.7.x. Instead
    of pinning to 0.7.9, simply pin to 0.7.x to avoid SQLAlchemy 0.8
    
    Unfortuantely '<0.8' matches '0.8.0b2', which is what we don't want.
    Therefore pinning it to '<=0.7.99' instead.
    
    This matches a corresponding change in openstack/requirements

    If the entry for the mapping between a quantum and a NVP port identifier

    add the mapping entry.
    This ensures upgraded folsom databases keep working with Grizzly code.

    port_security migration does not migrate data
    
    The port security migration previously created the correct table structure but
    it did not migrate the old data into this table. This patch adds code that
    copies the id fields from networks and ports into portsecuritybindings
    and networksecuritybindings tables.
    
    One thing to note is that in grizzly when a port is created on a network that
    has port_security_enabled=True, the port will also be created with
    port_security_enabled=True. But since ports in NVP were not previously
    created with the mac/ip security address pairs we have to set existing ports
    and networks port_security_enabled value to be False. One could easily
    write a script to set these values to True after applying this migration.
    
    Fixes bug 1153366

    Fix detection of deleted networks in DHCP agent.
    
    The DHCP-agent uses an in-memory networks cache to find out which networks must
    be deleted and which ones must be updated. In a case of agent restart the networks
    cache is empty and it's not possible to cleanup DHCP-processes serving networks
    which were deleted while the DHCP-agent was down. The proposed fix fills the networks
    cache when the agent starts using a list of networks which have existing config files.

    Add l3 db migration for plugins which did not support in folsom
    
    Bug 1153585
    
    Several plugins added l3 support in the grizzly release. This means that
    when upgrading from the folsom data model, the relevant data model changes
    should be applied.
    In order to do so this patch refactors the initial migration in order
    to be able to reuse the upgrade_l3 and downgrade_l3 routines.

    Fixes Hyper-V agent issue with mixed network types
    
    Fixes bug: 1153274
    
    Due to a bug in setting up external ports the Hyper-V agent fails to work in
    scenarios with VLAN and flat networks.
    
    Furthermore, a warning message on Hyper-V 2012 indicates that external
    port settings are ignored. As a result the agent can be simplified by
    avoiding vswitch external ports configurations.

    Ensure metadata access network does not prevent router deletion
    
    Bug 1152136
    
    This patch checks if a metadata access network is still present when
    removing a router in the NVP plugin. If yes, the network is detached
    from the router and then destroyed, thus ensuring a safe completion of
    the operation as well as removal of metadata access network resources.

    Do not delete subnets with IPs on router interfaces
    
    Bug 1152171
    
    This patch simply causes a 409 to be returned when attempting to
    delete a subnet which has IPs on ports whose device_owner is
    network:router_interface
    
    This does not address a similar problem that arises when the ips for
    a port owned by a router_interface are updated. This problem is hidden
    when updating a port which has been assigned the gateway_ip by an
    exception in the IP recycling process. However, it will hit when the
    port was explicitly added to the router, since it will have an ip
    different from the subnet's gateway ip.

    Add explicit egress rules to nvp security profile
    
    The following commit  7e26074b changed the previous behavior of quantum
    security groups by explicitly adding egress rules to the security profile.
    When these rules are removed the vm is no longer able to send traffic out.
    
    This patch adds these rules for NVP. One thing to note in the patch
    is that now a bunk rule of IPv4 127.0.0.1/32 is added to each security
    profile. The reason for this is by default NVP security profiles allow
    all egress traffic until a rule is added and then it just lets traffic
    matching those rules out. Adding this bunk rule achieves this behavior
    that quantum now uses.

    Update tox.ini to support RHEL 6.x.
    
    In order to support running unit tests on RHEL 6.x we need to patch
    eventlet with contrib/redhat-eventlet.patch. We already
    have support for this in the tools/install_venv_common.py but we
    need to make a couple changes to allow tox to consume this:
    
    1) Sync in the latest intall_venv_common.py from oslo. This changes
     patch to use the -N option (ignore already applied patches) and
     makes it safe to call the patching function more than once.
    
    2) Add a new patch_tox_venv.py script in tools.
    
    3) Update tox.ini to call patch_tox_venv.py before it runs tests and
     coverage.
    
    NOTE: This will hopefully go away eventually once this patch lands:

    Disable secgroup extension when Noop Firewall driver is used
    
    When Noop Firewall driver is used, Quantum security group actually does
    nothing in OVS and Linux Bridge plugin. It would be better to disable
    security group extension for such case to avoid confusion.
    By this we can determine whether quantum security group is enabled
    by checking the extension list.
    This commit changes OVS/LB/NEC/Ryu plugins with agent firewall_driver
    based security group implementation.

    Wrap quota controller with resource.Resource
    
    Fixes bug 1116137
    
    Currently the format of error message returned by quota extension was
    different with quantum other resource. Other resource will return as
    json(eg, '{"QuantumError": "error message"}'). But quota extension only
    return messages without any format.
    'quantum.api.v2.resource.Resource' provider error messages processing.
    So wrap quota controller with it.
    
    By the way, fix some small stuff:
    * Use specific exception 'QuotaTenantNotFound' instead of generic exception.
    * Correct error message.
    * Use attribute mapping checking the request body.

    isolated network metadata does not work with nvp plugin
    
    This patch removes the not self.conf.enable_metadata_network
    check before adding METADATA_DEFAULT_IP to ip_cidrs. This result
    of this is that the dhcp agent interface will have
    169.254.169.254/16 on it even if the network is
    enable_metadata_network=True which doesn't matter and happens anyway if one
    sets enable_meta_network=False. This change only effects the nvp plugin
    as this is the only one that uses the enable_metadata_network flag.

    Setup device alias by device flavor information.
    
    The router interface cannot be deleted since the MetaPlugin
    cannot get the flavor information from the port which has
    been deleted.
    The solution is setting up the alias for each device based
    on the flavor information, so the MetaPlugin still can get
    the flavor information from the device itself even the
    port has been deleted.
    
    Also the router interface cannot be deleted since the
    l3_port_check flag is not passed by MetaPlugin.

    L3 port delete prevention: do not raise if no IP on port
    
    Bug #1104337
    
    This patch alters the prevent_l3_port_deletion logic.
    PortInUse is raised only if the port has a device owner in
    (router_interface, router_gateway, floatingip) and an IP
    address.
    If no IP address is found on the port the port itself can
    be considered stale and therefore deleted as any association
    with l3 entities would be void.

    Change the default l3_agent_manager to L3NATAgent
    
    This is a l3-agent version of 349aa3ef3563c019f4d0a98fc30117ae0a6cade3.
    
    The combination of the plugin without agent extension support
    and L3NATAgentWithStateReport results in an error:
    "AttributeError: No such RPC function 'report_state'".
    
    This patch changes l3_agent_manager to be L3NATAgent instead of
    L3NATAgentWithStateReport since all plugins do not support
    L3NATAgentWithStateReport and having this as the default breaks
    all current deployments that upgrade source without changing
    their config files.

    Host route to metadata server with Bigswitch/Floodlight Plugin
    
    Host route to metadata server was not getting propagated
    to VM when using the Big Switch/Floodlight plugin. The
    reason being the update to the subnet (with the host
    route information) was not being picked up by the dhcp
    agent. This is being fixed here by sending a notification
    to the dhcp agent when the host route is added to the subnet.

    Ensure max length of iptables chain name w/o prefix is up to 11 chars.
    
    The maximum length of Linux iptables chain name must be less than or
    equal to 28 characters. In iptables_manager binary_name up to 16 chars
    is used as a prefix and a '-' follows it, so a chain name passed to
    iptables_manager must be less than 12 character long. Accordingky
    MAX_CHAIN_LEN should be changed from 28 to 12. Also this commit
    introduces a method to get a chain name with valid length.
    
    Since iptables_firewall module constructs a rule by directly using
    a chain name, iptable_firewall also must take care of the length.

    This change also adds some constraint checks for data integrity.

Author: Mark McClain <mark.mcclain@dreamhost.com>
Date:   Sun Feb 17 23:31:02 2013 -0500

    create a Quantum port to reserve VIP address
    
    fixes bug 1129672
    
    The API previously allowed a VIP to be created without verifying that
    the tenant had access to the subnet and that the address was valid and
    available.  This change modifies VIP creation behavior to create a
    Quantum port with the requested address.  If an address is not provided, an
    address is allocated using the normal allocation process for the subnet.
    
    This change also renames the port attribute to protocol_port to remove the
    ambiguity about which type of port it represents.
    
    Additional tests were added to validate the change in behavior.

    blueprint quantum-scheduler
    
    Note: since NVP already support scale-out + high availability for L3
    this only implements scheduling for dhcp.
    
    Also, we do not expose the API extension, just use the internal
    auto-scheduling.

    Add scheduling feature basing on agent management extension
    
    3rd part of blueprint quantum-scheduler
    
    1. Allow networks to be hosted by certain dhcp agents.
    Network to dhcp agent is a
    many to many relationship. Provide a simple
    scheduler to schedule a network randomly
    to an active dhcp agent when a network or port is created.
    2. Allow admin user to (de)schedule network to a
    certain dhcp agent manually.
    3. Allow routers to be hosted by a certain l3 agent.
    Router to l3 agent is a many to one relationship.
    Provide a simple scheduler to
    schedule a router to l3 agent if the router is not
    scheduled when the router is  updated.
    4. Auto schedule networks and routers to agents when agents
    start.
    5. Only support ovs plugin at this point

    refactor LoadBalancerPluginDbTestCase setUp()
    
    fixes bug: 1129417
    
    This fixes the bug by changing LoadBalancerPluginDbTestCase to inherit
    from test_db_plugin.QuantumDbPluginV2TestCase.  This allows for the
    plugin to access context managers for core resources.  Additionally,
    this change adds subresource and service_plugin support to
    QuantumDbPluginV2TestCase.

    Provide a default api_extensions_path for nvp_plugin
    
    The NVP plugin has several extensions within it's plugin directory. In order
    to tell quantum-server to load this, api_extensions_path must be set in
    quantum.conf. This is sort of painful because one needs to set this value.

    Metadata support for NVP plugin
    
    Bug #1121119
    
    Allows the NVP plugin to leverage the metadata proxy, by creating an
    ad-hoc topology for allowing access to a metadata proxy from a NVP
    router leveraging existing agents.
    
    This patch also removes previous code for metadata support in the
    NVP plugin, which was based on DHCP Option 121. This is now provided
    by the dhcp agent as well.

    plugin/nec: Make sure resources on OFC is globally unique.
    
    Fixes bug 1127664
    
    Network cannot be created in NEC plugin when OFC network ID is
    unique inside a tenant. Some OFC implmenetations generate a network
    ID unique inside a tenant. In this case generated network IDs on can
    be duplicated in system-wide. To fix it, this changes resource ID on
    OFC to REST URI to make sure IDs on OFC globally unique.
    
    Fixes bug 1120962
    
    Make sure NEC plugin creates shared networks
    
    In Quantum resource relationship is not limited inside a tenant.
    E.g., a non-owner tenant can create a port on a shared network.
    To deal with it the provider layer should not be aware of tenants
    each resource belongs to even when it has a kind of tenant concept.
    
    This commit changes ofc_manager to pass a parent resource for resource
    creation and identify a resouce by REST URI used to access OFC resources.
    It decouples Quantum resource access model from OFC resource models.
    OFC IDs created before this commit are also looked up.
    
    Primary keys of OFC ID mapping tables are changed to quantum_id because
    most of all accesses to these mapping tables are done by quantum_id.
    However the current version of alembic does not support changing primary
    keys, so new OFC ID mapping tables for tenant, network, port and packet
    filter are created. Dropping the previous mapping tables will be done
    along with the data migration logic.
    
    This commit also changes the following minor issues.
    - Make sure ID on ProgrammableFlow OpenFlow controller (PFC) is less than
      32 chars. The current PFC accepts only 31 chars max as ID and 127 chars
      as a description string.
    - Some database accesses created their own session and did not support
      subtransactions. Make sure to use context.session passed from the API layer.
    - Removes Unused methods (update_network, update_port) in trema/pfc drivers.

    Need to pass port['port'] to _get_tenant_id_for_create()
    
    This change set I9ac44a8e moved this logic out of the transaction
    which caused this bug. Unit tests did not catch this because
    this error is caused on NVP since the tenant_id is passed in as a tag
    and this change resulted in the tenant_id becoming None which is not
    an allowed tag value. Will improve error handling and edge cases like
    this to fake_nvpapiclient in different commit.

    be raised notifying the user of this. This patch changes the behavior so that
    now when  elements are found in the quantum db but not in NVP they are
    put into error state. In addition there error state elements are now able
    to be deleted if not found in nvp.
    
    This patch also removes outdated doc strings that seem to keep being adding.

    Mark password config options with secret
    
    Config object supports masking values when writing out if the secret
    flag is set on the option definition.  This change flags all quantum
    options containing a password.

    Add check for subnet update with conflict gateway and allocation_pools
    
    Fixes: bug 1062061
    
    The patch will raise exception 'GatewayConflictWithAllocationPools' when
    subnet update with conflict gateway and allocation_pools.
    
    Because before validate gateway ip with conflict allocation pools, we need
    validate allocation pools first. Move the validation of allocation pools
    into _validate_subnet. Then_allocate_pools_for_subnet is only responsible
    for pools allocation, and_validate_subnet is responsible for most validate
    for subnet.

    Fix NVP L3 gateway ports admin_state_down on creation
    
    Some of the transaction code that was added was removed in the L3 patch
    for nvp. This reintroduced the logic where ports would be created in the
    quantum db with admin_state_up=False. This caused L3 gateway patch ports
    to be created with admin_state_up=False.

    Remove cfg option default value and check if missing
    
    Currently, several plugins already check config options at __init__()
    for validity and will exit, if the settings are incorrect. However,
    most (all?) config option definitions have default values, so if the
    option is missing, a valid, but maybe unexpected value will be used.
    This is what occurred in the bug.
    
    The proposed fix is to take a config option, sql_connection, which is
    used by many plugins, and remove the default value. Then, at init
    time, when the config option is used in configure_db(), a check is
    made for the value. If the value is not set, a warning is logged and
    the value is set to the default, for db/api.py. It is expected that
    this will be the only module to consume this config option.
    
    Added UT to check that log warning is issued. Also, changed the timing
    so that the test takes 0.25 secs vs 12 secs. Removed UTs in two plugin
    tests that checked the default value for sql_connection.
    
    Other alternatives explored in previous patches, were to either
    raise an exception, or mark this config option as "required". This
    resulted in a large number of changes to tests, and required config
    overrides in plugins that imported quantum.db.api, but did not use
    sql_connection.
    
    In order to keep this solution (of this log-hanging fruit) fix, the
    proposed, simpler change is being made.
    
    Some cleanup to the Cisco plugin test case was also made, so that
    the mock was more in line with what production code does.

    Move auth_token configurations to quantum.conf
    
    keystone auth_token middleware now allows quantum to have auth_token
    configuration in quantum.conf. This commit moves the example of
    auth_token configuration from api-paste.ini to quantum.conf.
    This simplifies user configuations and users is no longer required
    to edit api-paste.ini.
    
    This change does not break backward compatibility. auth_token first
    tries the configurations in /etc/quantum/api-paste.ini and then the
    above configurations. Thus a user who already use api-paste.ini
    does not need to change it.

    Improvements to API validation logic.
    
    Do not automatically map generic exceptions like AttributeError to
    http errors (instead they should be handled closer to where they occur
    so that they can be "intelligently" converted to the appropriate
    error).
    
    Fix up some expected error codes in the unit tests.
    Improve some of the validation messages.
    Remove all use of locals() in attributes.py

    add non-routed subnet metadata support
    
    implements blueprint metadata-non-routed
    
    This patchset completes Quantum metadata support by adding metadata
    proxy support for isolated network segments.  The support requires that
    the guest instance request host routes, so that the DHCP port can be
    used to proxy metadata requests. NOTE: The cirros image does not support
    host router, so the UEC or equivalent required for testing and usage.

    Define root_helper variable under the [AGENT] section
    
    Fixes bug 1105523
    
    The patch set adds 2 new functions:
    1. register_root_helper - this enables all wanting to use
    the root_helper variable. This is under the section AGENT.
    2. get_root_helper - this is a helper function that returns the
    root_helper. This should be used when the application used to
    have the root_helper defined under the section DEFAULT. This
    ensures backward compatability.

    Because it was not necessary to transmit information via database,
    therefore the table is eliminated.
    
    Also, I remove openflow controller stuff from a configuration file
    of the Ryu plugin because it was not used anymore.

    Make get_security_groups() return security group rules
    
    In nova, get_security_groups() returns the security groups and their
    security group rules. In order to implement the security group proxy
    it needs to return this data to nova. This can be done using multiple
    requests from nova-api to quantum i.e: get_security_groups(), then
    get_security_group() for each group to obtain the rules. If one has a lot
    of security groups this will generate a lot of requests. Adding this change
    allows all the security groups and their rules to be returned in one shot.

    OVS cleanup utility removes veth pairs
    
    Fixes bug 1094185
    
    OVSInterfaceDriver plug() creates a veth pair and add it to an OVS
    bridge when ovs_use_veth=True. It is useful that OVS cleanup utility
    removes such veth paris in addition to removing OVS ports.
    
    Veth pairs to be removed are veth devices corresponding to ports
    removed when all_ovs_port==False. Veth pairs created to connect
    the integration bridge and physical bridges are not removed.

    Reqd. core_plugin for plugin agents & show cfg opts loaded.
    
    For the linuxbridge, openvswitch, nec, and ryu plugin agents,
    require the core_plugin configuration option, and throw an
    exception, if not present. Note: cannot make this a required
    option for all agents, as there are agent that include the
    core config options, but do not require core_plugin.
    
    In addition, log (as debug) the configuration options that
    have been loaded at start-up for these four agents. This will
    help with diagnosing start-up issues related to the
    configuraiton settings (or lack of).
    
    Tested that exception thrown, when missing core_plugin
    value in config file(s) included, for these four agents.

    Fix InvalidContentType can't be raised because of error in constructor
    
    InvalidContentType exception class is defined two times:
    in quantum.openstack.common.exception and quantum.common.exceptions
    with two different signatures.
    A lot of code like wsgi.Serializer.serialize() imports one of them but
    attempts to use it with the signature of another one, which ends with
    TypeError exception.
    
    This change fixes the bug by removing the second definition of
    InvalidContentType class and leaving only one which works correctly
    with all code. Also adds unit tests for exceptions to prevent this and similar bugs.

    In addition to this the code does the following:
    1. validates if the port exists on the OVS when a port update event takes
       place
    2. when a port is created the initial state is set as 'DOWN'. this is
       later updated by the agent when it is detected as up

    Use babel to generate translation file
    
    Fixes bug 1103519
    
    Following http://wiki.openstack.org/Translations to integrate transifex
    translation into quantum
    
    We added the empty file quantum/locale/quantum.pot to avoid the
    failure of the Jenkin's translation-jobs because git doesn't allow empty
    directory to be added into the repository.
    
    After this patch accepted, we need to do as below:
    1. Make the transifex quantum project
    (https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/quantum/) as part of the
    openstack transifex project hub and give access to the transifex
    openstack Jenkins account.
    
    2. Add the translation-jobs into openstack/openstack-ci-puppet for
    ceilometer.

     * Tests for iptables_manager were leaving lockfiles in the source
       tree due to the default lock path being in the openstack common
       tree.  This patch sets the lock_path option to an empty string
       for unit tests to ensure that a temporary location is used

    * Removes outdated doc string comments.
    * Changes update_network so that it doesn't update the network name in nvp
      since the name is retreved from the database.
    * Fixes get_network to return the correct status from nvp. Previously,
      it was always returning ACTIVE.

    _validate_security_groups_on_port was not validating external_ids
    
    The function _validate_security_groups_on_port was not validating a ports
    security group id if the id was an external id. The unit tests now use
    set_override() rather than setting cfg values directly. Lastly, quantum.conf
    now has the proxy_mode option exposed.

    Add a common test case for Port Binding Extension
    
    This commit merges the test cases for Port Binding Extension in
    Linux Bridge plugin and Open vSwitch plugin into a common one.
    It makes it easier for each plugin to support the port binding extension.
    
    This commit also adds binding:capabilities attribute to OVS plugin.
    Note that binding:capabilities is under discussion and it may be changed
    in the future. This change is done just to make OVS plugin support
    same as Linux Bridge plugin and pass the common unit test for the extension.

    switches when no longer required.

    Adds a Hyper-V Quantum plugin
    
    Blueprint quantum-plugin-hyper-v
    
    Initial Hyper-V Quantum plugin including VLAN support.
    Support for NVGRE networking will be added in a subsequent patch.
    The plugin architecture relies heavily on the OVS plugin, with some
    design differences to handle different network types via polymorphism.
    
    The plugin contains two main components:
    
    The plugin itself, to be executed on Linux or Windows
    The L2 agent, to be executed on each Hyper-V node
    
    L3 networking is currently handled on Linux with the existing agents.
    
    A Nova Quantum Vif plugin is included in the Nova project.

    Inform a client if Quantum provides port filtering feature
    
    Part of blueprint vif-plugging-improvements
    
    Quantum and Nova have duplicated functionality of packet filtering
    such as security groups and anti spoofing filters.
    By passing information whether Quantum supports the port filtering feature,
    Nova VIF driver can skip its own packet filtering setup.
    
    It is based on Daniel's advise in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/19436/

    Use default_notification_level when notification
    
    Fix bug 1089773
    
    Notifications in quantum api do not honor default_notification_level
    in quantum.conf and always use INFO level. On the other hand
    dhcp-agent refers to default_notification_level.
    If default_notification_level is set to a value other than INFO,
    dhcp-agent cannot receive notification from quantum server.

    NvpPluginException mixes err_msg and err_desc
    
    In a few places err_msg was passed to NvpPluginException though that
    expected err_desc. This patch makes NvpPluginException take err_msg
    instead and updates err_desc to err_msg when calling NvpPluginException

     - This change implements a loadbalancer plugin which doesn't
     do much thing but only db access. The object status needs to
     be updated when integrate with the lbaas agent.

    The current version of the nvp_api client does not load balance
    requests across multiple controllers. Instead, it just sends all the requests
    to one controller and if there is a controller failure it will failover
    to use another controller. This blueprint implements the ablility to
    utilize all controllers at once.

    refactor QuotaV2 import to match to other exts
    
    fixes bug 1096486
    
    The previous code used a special extension loading mechanism to
    selectively load the Quota model is the plugin matched and object path.
    This was intended to load models required by plugins, but this loading
    actually occurred after the db schema was created, so the model was not
    always loaded.  This fix refactors the code to make the QuotaV2 ext
    behave similarly to the other extensions ensuring the models are loaded
    prior to database schema creation.

    The version of WebOb being used in OpenStack was more than
    1 year old. This change updates to the latest stable release.
    
    Upgrading WebOb resolves a version conflict between OpenStack
    and Pecan, the web framework used by the Ceilometer team for
    version 2 of the ceilometer API.
    
    Refer to http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/news.html

    Provider network implementation for NVP plugin.
    
    blueprint nvp-provider-net
    
    Implements the provider network extension support. The list of valid network
    types has been updated to reflect the types supported by the nvp plugin.
    This was necessary otherwise validation would have always failed.
    Multiple logical switches might be associated with a quantum network; the
    first logical switch will always have the same id as the quantum network.
    Also now raises exception when port limit on overlay network is reached.
    
    This patch also adds a check for the maximum number of ports on 'standard'
    overlay networks, and performs some code refactoring for improving
    maintanability. For instance the NVPCluster class has been moved into its own
    module.

    Provide "atomic" database access for networks
    
    Fixes bug 1093637
    
    In the OVS and LB plugins there are cases when accessing the network
    has an additional database query. The patch enables this to occur
    without accessing an invalid database entry.

    Add OVS cleanup utility
    
    Fixes bug 1091605
    
    The utility should be called after rebooting an appliance. This
    will purge the openvswicth of configured tap devices.
    
    A configuration variable quantum_ports has been added. This is
    by default True which indicates that only Quantum ports will be
    deleted from the OVS. If this is set as False then all ports on the
    bridge will be deleted.

    Add eventlet db_pool use for mysql
    
    This adds the use of eventlet's db_pool module so that we can make mysql
    calls without blocking the whole process.
    New config options are introduced:
    
    sql_dbpool_enable -- Enables the use of eventlet's db_pool
    sql_min_pool_size -- Set the minimum number of SQL connections
    sql_max_pool_size -- Set the maximum number of SQL connections
    sql_idle_timeout  -- Timeout before idle sql connections are reaped
    
    The default for sql_dbpool_enable is False for now, so there is
    no forced behavior changes for those using mysql. sql_min_pool_size
    is defaulted to 1 to match behavior if not using db_pool.
    
    Fixes bug 1086173

    Fixed the unit tests using SQLite do not check foreign keys.
    
    The foreign key constraints will be enabled for each SQLite
    database connection.
    
    By default the foreign key constraints are disabled in SQLite,
    so some test cases failed after enabling the foreign key
    constraints for unit tests. This fixings also fixed the failed
    test cases because of the foreign key enforcement.

    dhcp.filters needs ovs_vsctl permission
    
    The dhcp agent calls ovs_vsctl so it will fail if using rootwrap
    and these aren't specified. The reason why this was working using
    rootwrap before is because there are other filters in
    etc/quantum/rootwrap.d that specifiy ovs_vsctl which
    allows the agent to make those calls. Fixes bug 1090072

    On the other hand, we notify l3 agent from quantum server when

    interface and gwport and router itself.

    Now Ryu can handle those informations itself, so remove the table itself and

    Removing unnecessary setUp()/tearDown() in SecurityGroupsTestCase
    
    This patch removes not required setUp()/tearDown() functions in
    SecurityGroupsTestCase. The functions are almost identical in
    test_db_plugin.QuantumDbPluginV2TestCase. Only difference is initializing
    ext_mgr which is done by SecurityGroupDBTestCase.setUp().
    
    And redundant inheritance of unittest2.TestCase for SecurityGroupsTestCase
    is fixed.

    Fix context problem
    
    On plugin side, we use normal API context if any to call RPC methods.
    We use our plugin dispatcher to convert RPC context into quantum admin
    context. After that the callback's functions have the first argument context
    as normal quantum context.
    
    On agent side, we use admin context without session property as its
    RPC calling context. Call back context is default RPCCommonContext in
    Openstack common modules.
    
    This patch also fixes the problem in the following bug:

    bug 1057844: improve floating-ip association checks
    
    allow multiple floating ips to be associated with the same internal port
    as long as they map to different external nets (not yet supported in
    Folsom) or different internal fixed IPs.  With Quantum, there is no
    need to disallow either scenario.

    The change allows loading several service plugins along with core plugin.
    
    The following functionality changes were made:
    1. Multiple plugins are loaded one per type
    2. QuantumManager now holds dictionary {plugin_type: plugin_instance}
       Core plugin is stored there as well
    3. Extensions are checked against all loaded plugins
    4. Service plugins are specified by service_plugins option in quantum.conf file
    5. Provide basic interface for service plugins
    6. Introduce dummy service plugin as example and PoC
    7. Service plugin's REST calls get corresponding plugin's common prefix
    8. Add UTs for new extension framework functionality and for QuantumManager

    "By default, all egress is allowed from the security
    group until you add outbound rules to the group (then only the egress you

    Use DB count to get resource counts.
    
    Fixes bug 1075369.
    
    During quota check we used to simply retrieve the entire collection
    of resources from the database, then counting them in Python. This
    patch introduces a specialized _get_collection_count() method, which
    instead take advantage of the DB's built-in count capabilities.
    
    In order to take advantage of this, plugins can now implement
    get_*_count() methods for their resources. This is used (if present)
    by the quota checking function.
    
    Patch incorporates review feedback from Dan W, Alex Xu, Zhongyue Luo,
    Edgar Magana, Akihiro Motoki and gongysh.

    Adds tests for attributes.is_attr_set
    
    ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED and None are singleton objects
    
    When conducting "is in" against a list of objects, they are compared using
    unequal unless they are the same object.
    http://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#in
    
    According to PEP8, they should be compared by their id not value
    Therefore the is_attr_set logic has changed to:
        return not (attribute is None or attribute is ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED)
    
    Wrote unittests for is_attr_set

    Explicitly include versioninfo in tarball.
    
    The most recent sync of openstack-common setup.py/version.py code
    seems to have cause quantum/versioninfo to disappear from the tarball.
    (see git commit d65bca8)
    
    This updates MANIFEST.in to explicitly include that file and seems
    to resolve the issue.
    
    Fixes LP Bug #1077035.

    Add indication when quantum server started.
    
    Bug #1076834
    
    Option values are printed in two phases due to our
    system's starting way. Last print will print out all
    option values included in all config files.
    
    In the end when quantum server started, we have an
    indication for it.

    Sync latest notifier changes from openstack-common
    
    Updates Quantum with the latest changes from openstack-commons
    notifier package:
    
        Rename rabbit_notifier to rpc_notifier.
    
        The previous rabbit_notifier module is generic and can be used
        for all RPC notifications.
    
        This commit moves the rabbit_notifier module to rpc_notifier and
        adds a new deprecated rabbit_notifier module which can be used for
        Grizzly so that users can have a chance to easily upgrade this
        config setting.
    
    Also updates the agent code and config file to reflect this change
    (and get unit tests to pass)
    
    Fixes LP Bug #1075330.

    Merge OVSVethInterfaceDriver into OVSInterfaceDriver
    
    Fixes bug 1049385
    
    Due to some issues using OVS internal interfaces across namespaces
    with OpenFlow controllers (bug 1048681), a patch introduced the
    OVSVethInterfaceDriver in addition to the base OVSInterfaceDriver.
    However, OVSVethInterfaceDriver is just a variation of OVSInterfaceDriver
    and the difference is how to create an interface (OVS internal vs veth).
    This patch merge OVSVethInterfaceDriver into OVSInterfaceDriver
    by introducing a new flag 'ovs_use_veth' (which defaults to False).

    Use sqlite db on file for unit tests
    
    bug 1054387
    
    So far unit tests were executed using an in-memory database.
    Memory was not being freed thus causing oom frequently due to
    the increased number of unit tests.
    Since sqlite in memory db do not work very well anyway with nose,
    we are moving to file-based databases; slower, but safer.
    
    Also, this patch removes a bunch of unit tests which do not add
    anything to code coverage or number or test cases exercised.

    bug 1052522
    
    the l3 agent checked if the external network bridge exists in its
    constructor, raising an uncaught exception if it did not.  this does not
    make much sense when running the l3-agent as a deamon, especially since
    it can be the case that the l3-agent starts before open vswitch.

    Add catch-call try/catch within rpc_loop in ovs plugin agent
    
    related to bug 1050512
    
    when running in db-mode, the ovs plugin agent will catch any unexpected
    exceptions generated during processing.  However, in rpc-mode, this
    does not happen, meaning a small error, even a transient one, causes the
    agent to exit completely.  Thic change adds a try-catch block to the
    rcp_loop(), causing the agent to log any unexpected exception, wait for
    the polling period, then retry the loop after resetting all state.

    Fix OVS and LB plugins' VLAN allocation table synchronization
    
    In both the openvswitch and linuxbridge plugins, if previous entries
    for a physical network have been completely removed from the
    network_vlan_ranges configuration variable, allocation table records
    for unallocated VLANs on that physical network are now removed from
    the DB at startup. The test_ovs_db and test_lb_db unit tests have also
    been extended to cover this case. Fixes bug 1052289.
    
    Test assertions that were added to the test_ovs_db unit test in
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/11388 have been added to the
    test_lb_db unit test. Fixes bug 1045596.

    Restore SIGPIPE default action for subprocesses
    
    Python ignores SIGPIPE on startup, because it prefers to check every
    write and raise an IOError exception rather than taking the signal. Most
    Unix subprocesses don't expect to work this way. This patch (adapted
    from Colin Watson's post at http://tinyurl.com/2a7mzh5) sets SIGPIPE
    back to the default action for quantum.agent.linux.utils.execute,
    quantum.common.utils.execute and quantum-rootwrap created subprocesses.

    always push down metadata rules for router, not just if gateway exists
    
    bug 1051842
    
    the l3-agent only pushes down some of the DNAT rules for metadata mapping
    if there is a gateway set on a router. However, the nova-api server could
    itself be running in the local router namespace (or on the same box as
    the quantum-l3-agent in the case were namespaces are disabled. In fact,
    with namespaces disabled, this is the likely setup for a simple
    environment). Thus, we should simply always push down the metadata nat
    rules for a router, router than waiting until a gateway is added.
    
    This patch also refactors the actions taken by the l3-agent when a router
    is added or removed into a separate function for improved readability,
    as add/removing the nat rules made these code segments even longer.

    Removed eval of unchecked strings.
    
     * eval() was previously used to marshall unchecked strings as
       filter parameters for QuantumDbPluginV2.get_ports() via
       the --fixed_ips flag.
     * This change removes the use of eval and cleans up the filtering
       implementation for get_ports().
     * The new filtering implementation does not support arbitrary
       OR'ing or AND'ing.  Instead, multiple values for a given filter
       key are logically OR'ed, and filters across keys are AND'ed.
     * Example usage - filter for .2 or .3 in the given subnet:
    
         quantum port-list -- --fixed_ips ip_address=10.0.0.3 \
             ip_address=10.0.0.2 subnet_id=nOtaRealId

    Fix for failing network operations in Cisco plugin
    
    Bug #1050545
    
    This fixes the exceptions occurring in the virtual switch mode of the
    Cisco plugin for create/delete/update network operations. The exceptions
    were occurring on account of the recent changes in the OVS module to the
    get_vlan and get_vlans methods, which were still being invoked here.
    Test configuration has been changed to increase the code coverage to
    catch such issues in the future. All changes are limited to the Cisco
    plugin and related tests.

    Add a new interface driver OVSVethInterfaceDriver.
    
    Fixes bug 1048681
    
    This commit fixes a bug that quantum agent using a namespace does not
    work with NEC plugin. NEC plugin uses an Open vSwitch as an OpenFlow switch,
    but an OVS port created by ovs-vsctl add-port becomes down when the port is
    moved to some network namespace. Usual OpenFlow controllers respect the
    OpenFlow port status. Since DHCP server (dnsmasq) is connected to the down
    port, DHCP server disappears from the virtual network.
    
    This behavior can be avoided if we use a similar approach used in
    BridgeInterfaceDriver, i.e., we first create a veth pair, add one veth device
    to OVS and move the other veth device to a network namespace. To accomplish it
    this patch introduces a new interface driver OVSVethInterfaceDriver.
    
    In addition, this patch adds a 'prefix' paramter to unplug(). When deleting
    a veth pair, a veth device added to OVS bridge is not removed automatically.
    Thus we need a mean to know the veth device name from a device_name to be
    removed. It is the reason to add 'prefix' parameter to unplug().

    Ensures that the Linux Bridge Plugin runs with L3 agent
    
    Fixes bug 1048968
    
    1. The external interface for the linux bridge will be created at run time.
    The configuration parameter external_network_bridge should be set as empty.
    That is, "external_network_bridge = ". The link between the network and
    the physical interface should be done via the provider network parameters.
    2. The plug operation for the linux bridge replaces the interface name
    prefix with tap. We need to ensure that the prefix length is 3 characters.

    Add enable_tunneling openvswitch configuration variable
    
    Not all systems that support Open vSwitch support its GRE tunneling
    feature that is not in the Linux kernel source tree. Therefore, a new
    configuration variable, enable_tunneling, applies to both the server
    and agent. Its default value is False, so it must be set to True to
    enable tunneling for tenant and/or provider networks. If
    enable_tunneling is False, the server will not allow creation of GRE
    networks, and the agent will not initialize the tunnel bridge and will
    log an error if there is an attempt to provision a GRE network. If it
    is True, the agent now logs an error and exits if it fails to
    initialize the patch ports used for the tunnel bridge. Fixes bug
    1045610.
    
    When there is an attempt to provision a flat or VLAN network and the
    agent has no bridge mapping configured for a the specified physical
    network, the agent will now log an error rather than crash.
    
    An undefined variable in a logging statement has been corrected.
    
    Logging levels for openvswitch have been checked and updated where
    necessary, and logging statements now avoid the % string substitution
    syntax. Fixes bug 1045592.
    
    The corresponding devstack update has already been merged.

    allow multiple l3-agents to run, each with one external gateway net
    
    bug #1042028
    
    Allows user to invoke L3-agent in a way that limits the agent to
    implementing only routers associated with a particular external network.
    Thus, it is possible to have a deployment with multiple external networks,
    since you can run one agent per external network.
    
    Also makes l3-agent pay attention to router admin_state_up field.

    Prevent floating-ip and ex-gateway ports should prevent net deletion
    
    bug 1044331
    
    Old behavior meant that any port with device owner starting with
    "network:" would be auto-deleted when a network was deleted.  We don't
    want that behavior for floating IPs or external network gateways.
    This provides a model where we explicitly list the set of owners that
    should be auto-deleted.
    
    - Also clean up NetworkInUse message to no longer mention 'attachment',
    since that is API v1 terminology.

    In create/update_subnet(), IP address fields (cidr, gateway_ip, host_routes,

    specified. IP version check for allocation_pools is already implemented,
    so this commit adds IP version checks for other IP fields.

    add local network type and use by default for tenant networks
    
    Fixes bug 1045142.
    
    This patch adds 'local' as a new value for provider:network_type,
    supported by the openvswitch and linuxbridge plugins. Networks of this
    type provide connectivity through a bridge for VMs and agents local to
    the host, but no external connectivity. They do not require
    provider:physical_network or provider:segmentation_id values. These
    local networks are intended mainly to support single-box
    zero-configuration testing (including quantum gating), but may have
    other uses as well.
    
    For openvswitch, the new OVS.tenant_network_type configuration
    variable selects what type of networks are allocated as tenant
    (i.e. non-provider) networks. It defaults to 'local', but must be
    changed to 'vlan' or 'gre' for openvswitch tenant networks to have
    external connectivity. The default value is intended to support
    single-box zero-configuration testing without any need to allocate
    physical network resources or configure bridges, and without requiring
    the operating system to support OVS GRE tunneling. It can also be set
    to 'none' to completely disable creation of tenant networks.
    
    For linuxbridge, the new VLANS.tenant_network_type configuration
    variable works similarly, with a value of 'vlan' supporting tenant
    networks with external connectivity.
    
    With either plugin, administrators can create provider local networks
    by specifying "--provider:network_type local". Additionally, with
    openvswitch, provider GRE networks can now be created by specifying
    "--provider:network_type gre --provider:segmentation_id <tunnel-id>".
    
    A corresponding devstack patch is available at
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/12456/. With this patch, the
    openvswitch and linuxbridge plugins are by default configured to
    support only local networks. A set of shell variables, documented in
    stack.sh, can be set in localrc to configure remote connectivity,
    including bridges/interfaces available for provider networks.

    Lower webob dep from v1.2.0 to v1.0.8
    
    All other OpenStack projects expect webob v1.0.8 yet Quantum expects
    v1.2.0. This discrepancy causes problems for certain projects that
    can't actually support v1.2.0 yet. This patch aligns the required
    version with that which the other OpenStack projects expect.

    Make sure floating IPs  + gateways must be on external nets
    
    bug #1042030
    
    - adds admin-writable, world-readable router:external attribute to
    the network object if L3 extension is loaded.
    - prevents floating ips from being created unless network is external
    - shortens L3 extensions alias from 'os-quantum-router' to 'router' to
    make attribute extensions more readable.
    
    WIP:
    - Need to add policy logic so non-admin users can always see external
    networks without requiring that these networks are shared (since VMs can
    always create ports on shared networks, but provider may want to have
    externals networks that VMs cannot directly plug into.
    
    Random clean-up:
    - prevent delete_network in plugins from implying it returns something
    - modify extensions.py so that exceptions during calls to
    get_extended_resources() will actually be logged if unexpected.
    - unset executable bit on test_iptables_manager.py to make sure tox
    actually runs it.

    restart dnsmasq when subnet cidr set changes
    
    fixes bug 1045828
    
    The original bug occurred because the set of subnet cidrs changed
    without a restart of dnsmasq.  As a result, dnsmasq would not respond
    with offers for fixed_ips assigned in the unknown cidr ranges even when
    the underlying host file had properly updated.
    
    This patch addresses the bug by restarting dnsmasq when the set of
    subnet cidrs changes.  When the set does not change, it will reload the
    options and allocations.

    add rootwrap filters to wrap ip netns exec
    
    fixes bug 1044083
    
    This patch adds specific filters for the ip command. The first filter
    matches ip with any subcomand except netns exec.  The second filter
    matches "ip netns exec" and then relies on the caller (match_filter) to
    verify the sub-command against the other filters. Matching the
    subcommand separately allows for a single set of filter definitions that
    work with and without namespaces.

    Create utility to clean-up netns.
    
    Fixes bug 1035366
    
    Adds namespace clean up utility called quantum-netns-cleanup which can be used
    to remove old namespaces.
    
    The --force option can be used to remove all Quantum namespaces and any
    remaining devices.  The force option is should not be run on a live Quantum
    systems.  It is intended for cleaning up devstack a after running
    unstack.sh (ideally this will be added to unstack.sh in the future).
    
    Example cmd line when cleaning up a devstack install:
    quantum-netns-cleanup --config-file /etc/quantum/quantum.conf \
    --config-file /etc/quantum/dhcp_agent.ini --force

    L3: make use of namespaces by agent configurable
    
    Fixes bug 1042104
    
    The fix follows the patch that was done on the DHCP agent to enable
    the user to configure the usage of namespaces. In the event that
    namspaces are disabled the agent is limited to running only one
    router. The agent needs to define the router_id that is supported.
    The process in this case is:
    1. create router
    2. start agent with router id

    the direction deletion of ports via the API for ports that are used as
    router interfaces, router gateways, of for floating IPs.
    
    Add a unit test to check such an invalid delete, and also updates
    unit tests to avoid them tripping over the new checks.

    Update rootwrap; track changes in nova/cinder
    
    Fix bug 1037815
    
    Summary: Copy/paste the essential parts of the rootwrap
      mechanism from nova/cinder into quantum.  This includes
      the core changes to filter.py and wrapper.py which deal
      with loading filters from files pointed to by
      rootwrap.conf
    Detailed changes:
      Transliterate the old rootwrap/*-agent.py files to
      new format, and put the results in etc/quantum/rootwrap.d
      Delete the *-agent.py files.
      Add conf to point to etc/quantum/rootwrap.d
      Add a unit test cribbed from nova to exercise the filter
      mechanism
      Add a unit test to exercise the actual filtered execution
    Note that as written, this patch does not set the default
      execute mechanism (in the agent .ini files) to rootwrap,
      leaves it as sudo.  That can be done in a followon
      change, or in distro specific packaging.
    Note also that there is still work to do around finishing
      and testing the filter specs themselves.  We've decided
      that that is out of scope for this patch.

    Cisco nexus sub-plugin update_network fix
    
    Fixes bug 1043147
    
    Currently, the cisco nexus sub-plugin doesn’t handle the network admin state parameter
    when it’s updated. The fix would enable the sub-plugin to handle an update of the admin
    state of the network. In update_network of the nexus sub-plugin, vlan corresponding to that network
    is added/removed from the nexus interfaces based on the network state. Unit tests are added as well.

    dnsmasq and the Quantum DHCP agent occurs via UNIX domain socket since dnsmasq
    may run in a network namespace.  The DHCP agent is responsible for
    relaying the updated lease expiration back the Quantum server.

    enable router deletion logic in l3-agent
    
    bug 1039387
    
    related to bp quantum-l3-fwd-nat
    
    previous diff logic did not attempt to detect that a router was deleted.
    
    Also, enabled actual deletion of namespace, since 066e48be08f155c29887f5846902fbf5e41b8c89 fixed the issue that was causing that to break.
    
    Also, make router loop pay attention to admin_state_up on router ports.

    Add quota per-tenant.
    
    blueprint quantum-api-quotas
    
    We implement it as an extension for linux bridge and ovs plugins.
    We also expose the /quotas/Xx url to client to operate the quota.
    We need admin role to show other tenant's quota, and to update quota data.
    Any user can show its own tenant's quota. An DB table is used to save the
    quota for each tenant.
    
    To use it, we have in quantum.conf:
    quota_driver = quantum.extensions._quotav2_driver.DbQuotaDriver
    
    The default quotas for each tenant are defined in quantum.conf too.
    
    In addition, modify extension framework to allow exposing a new resource and
    its controler. The extension can check the environment, such as configuration
    in global cfg.CONF to decide if it can be enabled.
    
    Also, we can define enabled extensions for each plugin in extensions.py
    New resources can be put into quota framework via quota_items in nova.conf

    Implementation of second phase of provider extension.
    
    Enhances provider extension to support flat networks and VLANs on
    multiple physical networks. Implements blueprint provider-networks.
    
    To create a flat network using the CLI with admin rights:
    
    net-create --tenant_id <tenant-id> <net-name> --provider:network_type flat --provider:physical_network <physical-network>
    
    To create a VLAN network using the CLI with admin rights:
    
    net-create --tenant_id <tenant-id> <net-name> --provider:network_type vlan --provider:physical_network <physical-network> --provider:vlan_id <vlan-id>
    
    The provider extension is supported by the linuxbridge and openvswitch
    plugins and their agents [openvswitch phase 2 implementation is
    in-progress, and does not yet support flat networks or multiple
    interfaces].
    
    Ranges of VLANs available on named physical networks for normal
    allocation are specified in the plugin's config file via the
    ListOpt syntax:
    
    network_vlan_ranges = <physical_network>:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>
    
    The mapping of each named physical network to its physical network
    interface is specified (per-agent-host) in the agent's config file via
    the ListOpt syntax:
    
    physical_interface_mappings = <physical_network>:<physical_interface>
    
    See quantum/plugins/linuxbridge/README for details and examples of
    network_vlan_ranges and physical_interface_mappings usage.
    
    Also, bulk operations are enabled for the linuxbridge plugin.

    Adds the 'public network' concept to Quantum
    
    Implements blueprint quantum-v2-public-networks
    
    This patch allows Quantum to handle public networks. It modifies the
    API adding a new attribute to the network resource ('shared')
    and enhances the policy engine in order to handle the behaviour of
    the service wrt shared networks.
    Policy.json specifies a default behaviour which can be changed by
    the administrator, even at runtime.
    Tests added to test_db_plugin validate 'obvious' behaviour - such as
    that only the ports belonging to a given tenant should be returned
    even when they are queried on a public network.
    Tests added to test_policy instead validate the changes added to the
    policy engine.

    Use function registration for policy checks
    
    The original policy framework allowed new policy checks to be created
    through inheritance.  This is somewhat clunky and unnecessary in
    Python.  This change refactors policy.py to allow new policy checks
    to be registered using an @register() decorator.  One consequence is
    that HttpBrain is deprecated.
    
    Care has been taken to ensure backwards compatibility; deprecation
    warnings will be emitted for uses of HttpBrain or the inheritance-
    based checks.
    
    (Pull-up from openstack-common, with deprecation of HttpBrain.)

    Replace openvswitch plugin's VlanMap with vlan_ids DB table.
    
    Fixes bug 1023167.
    
    The openswitch plugin's in-memory VlanMap is replaced with a vlan_ids
    DB table similar to that used by the linuxbridge plugin. This will
    prevent conflicting VLAN assignments if multiple server replicas are
    run, and also sets the stage for phase 2 of the provider-networks BP
    implementation that will add support for multiple physical
    networks.
    
    Unlike with the current linuxbridge plugin, the contents of the
    openvswitch plugin's vlan_ids table are properly updated at startup in
    case the vlan_min or vlan_max configuration variables have changed.
    
    A new test_ovs_db test case has been added.
    
    The primary key of the vlan_bindings table is changed from the vlan_id
    to the network_id, which is now a foreign key, and network deletion is
    now properly handled.
    
    The net_id has been removed from the VlanIdInUse exception, requiring
    a minor update to the linuxbridge plugin. The new NoNetworksAvailable
    exception, with ResourceExhausted as its base class, is returned when
    no more VLANs are available.

    This commit introduces 'auth_strategy' flag to quantum.conf and
    a pipeline used is determined depending on the flag. Supported values for
    this flag are 'keystone' (default) and 'noauth' at the moment.

    Enable agents and plugins to use the same configuration file.
    
    The change also implements blueprint agent-logging (this
    was due to the fact that the existing logging in the agents
    did not work with the change)
    
    Devstack support for the above is in
    https://review.openstack.org/10267
    
    Notes:
    - The service and agent can be run with multiple configuration
      files by using the CLI parameters --config-file <filename>
    - The agent now makes use of the logging and debugging flags
      defined in quantum.conf. This follows the standard common
      configuration command line rules.

    Merge "Add v2 API support for the Cisco plugin Blueprint cisco-plugin-v2-api-support"

commit f43b1cede93bca9acfa493c7f3c83ff5ab961587
Author: Gary Kotton <gkotton@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 24 02:28:56 2012 -0400

    Update openstack-common files.
    
    The RPC support requires that the fanout_cast messages enable
    the application to set the topic. This was fixed in
    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/10125/.
    
    In addition to this the jsonutils.py was updated.

    Initial V2 implementation of provider extension.
    
    Initial provider extension implementation. Specify vlan_id using the
    CLI with admin rights via "net-create --tenant_id <tenant-id>
    <net-name> --provider:vlan_id <vlan-id>". Also includes
    provider:vlan_id in reply messages for admins. The extension is
    supported in the linuxbridge and openvswitch plugins.
    
    Partially implements blueprint provider-networks.

    Implements data-driven views and extended attributes.
    
    The quantum/api/v2/views.py module is replaced by is_visible
    properties in the RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP defined in
    quantum/api/v2/attributes.py. Extensions are given the ability to add
    extended attribute descriptions to this map during initialization,
    allowing extended attributes to be implemented similarly to core
    attributes in plugins.
    
    Resolves bug 1023111.

    Add v2 API support for the Cisco plugin
    Blueprint cisco-plugin-v2-api-support
    
    New meta-plugin which makes use of the Quantum db_plugin and supports
    the new v2 API
    Changes to the Cisco DB model, now reusing quantum DB for core attributes
    Changes to the device sub plugins to access the quantum DB for core
    resources' state versus Cisco DB
    Addition of fake/dummy drivers to support testing of the device sub
    plugins even without actual hardware
    New v2 unit tests which exercise the meta-plugin and the device sub
    -plugins as well
    In general creating new v2 modules such that v1.x code can be deprecated
    easily by deleting the older modules. The following files are v2
    versions of older modules, only the imports have changed, most of the
    other code is the same as from the older modules (already reviewed):

    The fix is 'inspired' (ie: copied) from nova. It is cached in memory unless a
    change in policy file is detected. In that case, a reload is triggered.
    
    This patch also adds a set of unit tests for quantum/policy.py, which was

    The code enable defining validity checks for input variables. This

        - type:values - checks that data is valid according to a list of values
        - type:mac_address - checks that data is a valid mac address
        - type:ip_address - checks that data is a valid ip address
        - type:subnet - checks that data is a valid cidr
        - type:regex - checks that data matches a regular expression (for
          example checking UUID validity)

    Fixes bug1025150
    
    Ensures that each attribute which is used by the policy engine is not
    removed by the plugin when the 'fields' query parameter is specified.
    This could be better achieved by not having the plugin perform this
    selection, but as it is part of the plugin interface, it's probably better
    not to introduce changes which alter it.

    Introduce files from openstack common.
    
    Because the openstack common project does not stick to latest pep8 rules,
    I have to exclude some bad-ruled files in the tox.ini and run_tests.sh.
    However pep8 does not support exclude option in the format quantum/openstack/common,
    so I have to exclude some of openstack common files one by one.
    
    Also, I have changed the Qunatum Context to base on the common context.
    
    I does not update the setup.py in our openstack common dir and the one
    under quantum top dir, since it should be maintained in a consistent way
    across all of openstack projects.
    
    After this introduction, we are ready for notification feature.

    A common configuration parse function is used by the service and the agent.

    Fix v2 API policy checks when keystone is in use.
    
    bug 1022032.  There were significant errors in how
    the policy framework was being invoked, but existing
    tests did now show them, since they always invoked the
    API with no keystone context.  This patch fixes those
    issues and add a significant amount of test coverage
    simulating API calls with keystone enabled.
    
    As part of this patch, we also needed to add a tenant-id
    attribute to the subnet object.  Furthermore, we
    changed the API validation code to prevent tenant-id from
    being changed with a PUT, since changing it after creation
    could invalidate some of the create checks we're planning
    on adding (e.g., that a port is being created on a network
    owned by the same tenant).

    Add 'allocation_pools' to Quantum v2 API subnets.
    
    This changeset adds a new parameter, 'allocation_pools' to the 'subnet'
    resource of the Quantum v2 API.
    Allows for creating and validation of subnets with multiple allocation pools.
    This commit only deals with POST verb (subnet creation).
    PUT verb (subnet update) will be dealt with in a subsequent commit.
    
    This is the first commit for fixing bug #1016308

    v2 support for the linux bridge plugin
    
    blueprint lb-api-v2-support
    
    Plugin support for the linuxbridge using the v2 API
    
    1. The core_plugin in quantum.conf must be set to:
    quantum.plugins.linuxbridge.LinuxBridgePluginV2.LinuxBridgePluginV2
    2. By default the agent is v2. A configuration file entry 'target_v2_api'
    in the section 'AGENT' can be set as False to support v1.

    Check if interface exists in bridge prior to adding.
    
    This fixes bug 1019730. The fix for bug 1000406 ensures that return
    values of shell commands are checked. The command
        utils.execute(['brctl', 'addif', bridge_name, interface],
                       root_helper=self.root_helper)
    would cause an exception if there was more than one attachment
    on the network. The reason for this was the interface already existed
    on the bridge.

    Implement IP address allocation.
    
    This fixes bug 1008029.
    
    The allocation is done as follows (according to the value of
    port['fixed_ips']):
    - api_router.ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED - Quantum will generate an IP address.
    If a v4 subnet is defined then a v4 address will be generated. If
    a v6 subnet is defined then a v6 address will be generated. If both are
    defined then both v4 and v6 addresses will be generated.
    - user configuration which may contain a list of the following:
       - ip_address - the specific IP address will be generated
       - subnet_id - an IP address from the subnet will be generated

    Ensure unique mac address allocation.
    This is the first part of bug 1008029
    
    If the port command does not contain a MAC address then Quantum will generate
    a random MAC address. The mac address will be saved in the database to ensure
    that it is not used by another port on the same network.
    
    Added mock-based test for mac exhaustion.

    (This means that attributes are not filtered out based on policies.)

    Remove hardcoded version for pep8 from tools/test-requires
    
    In email discussions we decided that the master branch should always
    pull in the lastest version of the pep8 tool, which keeps us closest
    to the real pep-8 document.  Therefore, I'm removing the hardcoded
    version here to match the lack of a pep8 version in tox.ini (which is
    what the CI infrastructure uses when running the gating pep8 checks).
    
    Note that your pep8 version will only update when you re-run
    pip install --upgrade -r tools/test-requires .

    Add common dir for shared agent code, add OVS lib.
    
    bp quantum-agent-common
    
    Adds a common directory that can be used for code shared by agents for
    different plugins.  Also seeds this directory with an OVS library,
    removing that code from the openvswitch plugin itself.  This code
    can then be leveraged by other plugins (e.g., Ryu) who have similar code.
    
    Also add a suite of mox-based tests for OVS lib.
    
    Also add more powerful OVS flow expression builder as suggested by
    salv-orlando, plus additional flow expression testing.
    
    Note: the expectation is that this directory will be used for much of the
    agent functionality that is similar to what Nova's nova/network/linux_net.py
    file included, such as iptables manipulation, dhcp manipulation, etc.
    
    People should be careful about changing code in this directory in a
    non-backward compatible way, as other plugins may be using the code as well.

    According to plugin api of QuantumPluginBase, unplug_interface

    To unplug a non-attached port should not raise Exception.
    After this modification, to unplug an non-attached port will have no impact.
    In addition, I remove the 'network = db.network_get(net_id)' since
     'db.validate_port_ownership(tenant_id, net_id, port_id)' statement has taken
    care of the check.

    OVS plugin: add tunnel ips to central database
    
    bp simplify-ovs-tunnel-mgmt
    
    Makes the OVS plugin agent report its own IP address to the centralized
    quantum database, and build its set of tunnels based on the contents of
    this centralized database.  This removes the need for a removes need for
    a 'remote-ips' file on each compute node that needs to be updated
    when a new host is added.
    
    Also:
    - simplifies error handling within tunnel manager daemon_loop
    - fixes issues with operational status not working for tunnel-mode
    - fixes issue that not-stripping vlan of tunneled packet potentially
    crashes OVS, causing flows to get wiped.

Author: Bob Kukura <rkukura@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 13 17:23:06 2012 -0400

    Add root_helper to quantum agents.
    
    When running commands that require root privileges, the linuxbridge,
    openvswitch, and ryu agent now prepend the commands with the value of
    the root_helper config variable. This is set to "sudo" in the plugins'
    .ini files, allowing the agent to run as a non-root user with
    appropriate sudo privilidges.
    
    If root_helper is changed to "sudo quantum-rootwrap",
    then the command being run will be filtered against lists of each
    agent's valid commands in quantum/rootwrap. See
    http://wiki.openstack.org/Packager/Rootwrap for details.
    
    Fixes bug 948467.

    Fix some plugins that don't check that nets + ports are owned by tenant
    
    bug 942713. This bug confuses the validate_networks() method of
    QuantumManager in Nova, causing it to believe that it is valid for a
    tenant to plug into a particular network when in fact that network is not
    owned by the tenant, nor the "provider".
    
    The patch also adds unit tests to confirm correct plugin behavior.
    
    This patch fixes the issue for the Sample Plugin, the OVS plugin,
    the Linux Bridge plugin, and the Ryu plugin, all of which has the
    same DB model.  Validated the fix with the unit tests.
    
    
    I couldn't run the unit tests for the NVP plugin standalone, but by
    inspection, the code seems to handle this case.  I wasn't able to run
    the Cisco plugin unit tests, and that code uses its own DB model, so I
    am uncertain whether this issue exists in that plugin.

    Return appropriate error for invalid-port state in create port API.
    
    Fixes ovs-plugin to return appropriate error code when create port API is passed a port state value other than ACTIVE or DOWN. Fixes bug 919265.
    
    Also added unit-test to test the behavior and verified it using ovs-plugin with devstack.

    blueprint quantum-ovs-tunnel-agent
    
    Enhance existing Quantum OVS Plugin with a tunneling agent that
    enables Hypervisors to be connected via GRE tunnels. The new agent
    can be enabled/disabled via configuration file and provides backwards
    compatibility with existing non-tunneling OVS Agent.

    unittests: setup FLAGS.state_path properly: bug 938637
    
    This patch fixes bug 938637
    Quantum unittests doesn't pass with plugin (openvswitch, linuxbridge) in venv
    as follows.
    This is because config file under <quantum src>/etc/ can't be find due to
    FLAGS.state_path points to <python-quantumclient src> which can be different
    from <quantum src>.
    Set FLAGS.state_path to <quantum src> when quantum unit tests.

    Cleanup the source distribution.
    
    Missing text files such as LICENSE and various READMEs are now
    included in the tarball source distribution. The Makefile and shell
    script for installing the openvswitch agent on xen are also now
    included. The openvswitch and linuxbridge agents are included, and
    executable wrapper scripts for the agents are provided. The cisco and
    linuxbridge nova drivers are now setup to be run from the quantum
    namespace rather than copied to nova. Finally, the setup_*.py scripts
    have been removed from the project. Fixes bug 925074.
    
    Test by running "python setup.py sdist" and examining the generated
    tarball.

    This moves the tree to having a standard setup.py.  For those who want to
    build individual packages you'll need to use the setup_<package>.py files.
    
    This allows us to support the traditional setup.py commands (i.e. sdist, etc)
    that the openstack CI scripts will be using.

    Remove plugin pip-requires.
    
    Fixes bug 906636.
    
    The cisco plugin included ncclient, but does not use it when testing.
    The openvswitch plugin included SQLAlchemy which is already required
    by quantum itself.
    
    I've also changed the install_venv.py script to only look at
    tools/pip-requires, so that it behaves more like the rest of the
    OpenStack projects.  In Jenkins that's the only file we look at
    to see if we need to rebuild the virtualenv, so it would be best
    if the project only hade one pip-requires.
    
    Also added .gitignore to ignore files created during testing.

    Removes most of the content from the README to avoid it becoming outdated
    and stale given that our currently maintained docs are now on

    extension writing, etc. this means text from the README is being
    transferred directly from the README to an external doc so we make
    sure we don't lose anything.

    Implementation of the BP services-insertion-wrapper inside the Cisco Plugin
    
    This utility offers a simplify way to insert and remove network services
    in the path of the traffic to the server VMs, by splitting the network
    into two, and having the service bridge between the two networks,
    in the process applying the service. This model is called In-Path
    (Bump in the Wire)

    blueprint operational-status-ovs-plugin
    
    Implements operational status API for OVS plugin.   Uses existing
    database model for operational status.  For network, status is always
    up.  For a port, status is down unless there is an agent that
    indicates that the port is active on its compute host.
    
    Updated: use Salvatore's config hook to set default op-status for OVS
    in OVS run_tests.py
    
    Updated: fixed issue in _make_port_dict() found by Brad.

    bug #891267 : for XS, grab iface-id from XAPI directly if needed.
    
    The version of OVS that ships with XenServer by default does not include
    the script to automatically sync the XAPI other_config:nicira-iface-id
    field of a VIF with the external_ids:iface-id in the OVS interfaces table.
    Thus, make the agent grab the value directly from XAPI if iface-id is
    not already populated.

    output.

    Bug #875995: Quantum README fixes
    
    Fix the most obvious issues with the Quantum README and add pointers to
    external documentation resources.
    
    In a future commit, we plan to remove most of the content in the README
    and leave it just as references to external documentation.  However,
    this change requires us to be able to support multiple version of our
    external documentation (not yet possible) and have a good location for
    developer documentation.

    Swich over to update_{net,port} instead of rename_net and set_port_state
    
    This commit changes the plugin interface so that we have update() functions
    that can upate any attributes of the port or network.  In the future when we
    add more things like operational state this will give us the flexibility to be
    able to update those.  This also allows data extensions to be passed into the
    update calls.
    
    Thanks to Tyler and the others at cisco for making the changes to the cisco
    plugins and tests (their patch is included in this commit).

    1) Created a DummDataPlugin in SamplePlugin module.
    
    		- DummyDataPlugin is a sligh improvment over QuantumEchoPlugin in that
               the plugin returns hard-coded data structures.
    
    2) Created a CLI that enabled quantum plugin writers to test their plug-in implementation.
    
    		- Currently I am using DummyDataPlugin to test and run the CLI
               but if anybody has another better Quantum plug-in, please modify
               manager.py to use your plug-in and drive the plug-in using the CLI.
            - Running the CLI against wider variety of plug-ins will help the CLI
               evolve and improve. Please free to send patches.
    
    3) TODO: list
    
    	- Finalize the plug-in data model
        - Finalize the exception and make the plug-in throw exceptions
    	- Write unit tests for plug-in qualification and CLI testing.

        Abstract class specification.
    3) Demonstrated plugin registration and invocation using the demo
        plugin called "QuantumEchoPlugin"
    4) Created the initial file structure for a quantum CLI
    5) Seeded the utils module that will contain frequently used Quantum utilities.
    6) Modified the manager module to initialize and register the quantum plugin
        defined in a configuration file. I have hard-coded the path to plugin for now
        but this will move to a quantum.conf file.
    
    TODO:
    
    1) Finish up the Quantum CLI
    2) Write Quantum unit tests that can be run against any plug-in for certification.
    3) Create a working quantum plugin.

    blueprint api-operational-status
    
    Adds a new attribute expressing current operational status for port and network resources
    
    Also includes:
    - db models: changes to accomodate operational status concept
    - unit tests: changes to include different validation functions for API v1.0 and v.1.1
    
    This changeset does not include changes to the client library
    
    NOTE: Addressing issue concerning unit tests for OVS plugin. API unit tests launched with
    PLUGIN_DIR set to Cisco's plugin work fine as well.
